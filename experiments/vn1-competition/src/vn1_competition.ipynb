    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The VN1 Forecasting Accuracy Challenge tasked participants with forecasting future sales using historical sales and pricing data. The goal was to develop robust predictive models capable of anticipating sales trends for various products across different clients and warehouses. Submissions were evaluated based on their accuracy and bias against actual sales figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition was structured into two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 1** (September 12 - October 3, 2024): Participants used the provided Phase 0 sales data to predict sales for Phase 1. This phase lasted three weeks and featured live leaderboard updates to track participant progress.\n",
    "- **Phase 2** (October 3 - October 17, 2024): Participants utilized both Phase 0 and Phase 1 data to predict sales for Phase 2. Unlike Phase 1, there were no leaderboard updates during this phase until the competition concluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook, we'll be showcasing how to create forecasts with ETS, ARIMA, CES and Theta models from  `statsforecast` as well as using an ensemble of this models and a hierarchical reconciliation."

## Introduction

**Exogenous regressors** are variables that can affect the values of a
time series. They may not be directly related to the variable that is
beging forecasted, but they can still have an impact on it. Examples of
exogenous regressors are weather data, economic indicators, or
promotional sales. They are typically collected from external sources
and by incorporating them into a forecasting model, they can improve the
accuracy of our predictions.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a good understanding of how to
incorporate exogenous regressors into
[StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/)’s models.
Furthermore, you’ll see how to evaluate their performance and decide
whether or not they can help enhance the forecast.

## Install libraries

We assume that you have StatsForecast already installed. If not, check
this guide for instructions on [how to install
StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/installation.html)


```python
# uncomment the following line to install the library
# %pip install statsforecast
```


```python
import pandas as pd
```

## Load and explore the data

In this example, we’ll use a single time series from the [M5
Competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001187#:~:text=The%20objective%20of%20the%20M5,the%20uncertainty%20around%20these%20forecasts.)
dataset. This series represents the daily sales of a product in a
Walmart store. The product-store combination that we’ll use in this
notebook has `unique_id = FOODS_3_586_CA_3`. This time series was chosen
because it is not intermittent and has exogenous regressors that will be
useful for forecasting.

We’ll load the following dataframes:

-   `Y_ts`: (pandas DataFrame) The target time series with columns
    \[`unique_id`, `ds`, `y`\].
-   `X_ts`: (pandas DataFrame) Exogenous time series with columns
    \[`unique_id`, `ds`, exogenous regressors\].


```python
base_url = 'https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com'
filters = [('unique_id', '=', 'FOODS_3_586_CA_3')]
Y_ts = pd.read_parquet(f'{base_url}/m5_y.parquet', filters=filters)
X_ts = pd.read_parquet(f'{base_url}/m5_x.parquet', filters=filters)
```

We can plot the sales of this product-store combination with the
`statsforecast.plot` method from the
[StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/core.html#statsforecast)
class. This method has multiple parameters, and the requiered ones to
generate the plots in this notebook are explained below.

-   `df`: A pandas dataframe with columns \[`unique_id`, `ds`, `y`\].
-   `forecasts_df`: A pandas dataframe with columns \[`unique_id`,
    `ds`\] and models.
-   `engine`: str = `matplotlib`. It can also be `plotly`. `plotly`
    generates interactive plots, while `matplotlib` generates static
    plots.


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
```


```python
StatsForecast.plot(Y_ts)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/how-to-guides/Exogenous_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-6-output-1.png)

The M5 Competition included several exogenous regressors. Here we’ll use
the following two.

-   `sell_price`: The price of the product for the given store. The
    price is provided per week.
-   `snap_CA`: A binary variable indicating whether the store allows
    SNAP purchases (1 if yes, 0 otherwise). SNAP stands for Supplement
    Nutrition Assitance Program, and it gives individuals and families
    money to help them purchase food products.


```python
X_ts = X_ts[['unique_id', 'ds', 'sell_price', 'snap_CA']]
X_ts.head()
```

|     | unique_id        | ds         | sell_price | snap_CA |
|-----|------------------|------------|------------|---------|
| 0   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-01-29 | 1.48       | 0       |
| 1   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-01-30 | 1.48       | 0       |
| 2   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-01-31 | 1.48       | 0       |
| 3   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-02-01 | 1.48       | 1       |
| 4   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-02-02 | 1.48       | 1       |

Here the `unique_id` is a category, but for the exogenous regressors it
needs to be a string.


```python
X_ts['unique_id'] = X_ts.unique_id.astype(str)
```

We can plot the exogenous regressors using `plotly`. We could use
`statsforecast.plot`, but then one of the regressors must be renamed
`y`, and the name must be changed back to the original before generating
the forecast.


```python
StatsForecast.plot(Y_ts, X_ts, max_insample_length=0)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/how-to-guides/Exogenous_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-9-output-1.png)

From this plot, we can conclude that price has increased twice and that
SNAP occurs at regular intervals.

## Split train/test set

In the M5 Competition, participants had to forecast sales for the last
28 days in the dataset. We’ll use the same forecast horizon and create
the train and test sets accordingly.


```python
# Extract dates for train and test set 
dates = Y_ts['ds'].unique()
dtrain = dates[:-28]
dtest = dates[-28:]

Y_train = Y_ts.query('ds in @dtrain')
Y_test = Y_ts.query('ds in @dtest') 

X_train = X_ts.query('ds in @dtrain') 
X_test = X_ts.query('ds in @dtest')
```

## Add exogenous regressors

The exogenous regressors need to be place after the target variable `y`.


```python
train = Y_train.merge(X_ts, how = 'left', on = ['unique_id', 'ds']) 
train.head()
```

|     | unique_id        | ds         | y    | sell_price | snap_CA |
|-----|------------------|------------|------|------------|---------|
| 0   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-01-29 | 56.0 | 1.48       | 0       |
| 1   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-01-30 | 55.0 | 1.48       | 0       |
| 2   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-01-31 | 45.0 | 1.48       | 0       |
| 3   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-02-01 | 57.0 | 1.48       | 1       |
| 4   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2011-02-02 | 54.0 | 1.48       | 1       |

## Create future exogenous regressors

We need to include the future values of the exogenous regressors so that
we can produce the forecasts. Notice that we already have this
information in `X_test`.


```python
X_test.head()
```

|      | unique_id        | ds         | sell_price | snap_CA |
|------|------------------|------------|------------|---------|
| 1941 | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-23 | 1.68       | 0       |
| 1942 | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-24 | 1.68       | 0       |
| 1943 | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-25 | 1.68       | 0       |
| 1944 | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-26 | 1.68       | 0       |
| 1945 | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-27 | 1.68       | 0       |

> If the future values of the exogenous regressors are not available,

> forecast.

## Train model

To generate the forecast, we’ll use
[AutoARIMA](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#autoarima),
which is one of the models available in StatsForecast that allows
exogenous regressors. To use this model, we first need to import it from
`statsforecast.models` and then we need to instatiate it. Given that
we’re working with daily data, we need to set `season_length = 7`.


```python
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA
```


```python
# Create a list with the model and its instantiation parameters 
models = [AutoARIMA(season_length=7)]
```

Next, we need to instantiate a new StatsForecast object, which has the
following parameters.

-   `df`: The dataframe with the training data.
-   `models`: The list of models defined in the previous step.
-   `freq`: A string indicating the frequency of the data. See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).
-   `n_jobs`: An integer that indicates the number of jobs used in
    parallel processing. Use -1 to select all cores.


```python
sf = StatsForecast(
    models=models, 
    freq='D', 
    n_jobs=1,
)
```

Now we’re ready to generate the forecast. To do this, we’ll use the
`forecast` method, which takes the following arguments.

-   `h`: An integer that represents the forecast horizon. In this case,
    we’ll forecast the next 28 days.
-   `X_df`: A pandas dataframe with the future values of the exogenous
    regressors.
-   `level`: A list of floats with the confidence levels of the
    prediction intervals. For example, `level=[95]` means that the range
    of values should include the actual future value with probability
    95%.


```python
horizon = 28
level = [95]

fcst = sf.forecast(df=train, h=horizon, X_df=X_test, level=level)
fcst.head()
```

|     | unique_id        | ds         | AutoARIMA | AutoARIMA-lo-95 | AutoARIMA-hi-95 |
|-----|------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-23 | 72.956276 | 44.109070       | 101.803482      |
| 1   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-24 | 71.138611 | 40.761467       | 101.515747      |
| 2   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-25 | 68.140945 | 37.550083       | 98.731804       |
| 3   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-26 | 65.485588 | 34.841637       | 96.129539       |
| 4   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-27 | 64.961441 | 34.291973       | 95.630905       |

We can plot the forecasts with the `statsforecast.plot` method described
above.


```python
StatsForecast.plot(Y_ts, fcst, max_insample_length=28*2)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/how-to-guides/Exogenous_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-17-output-1.png)

## Evaluate results

We’ll merge the test set and the forecast to evaluate the accuracy using
the [mean absolute
error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) (MAE).


```python
res = Y_test.merge(fcst, how='left', on=['unique_id', 'ds'])
res.head()
```

|     | unique_id        | ds         | y    | AutoARIMA | AutoARIMA-lo-95 | AutoARIMA-hi-95 |
|-----|------------------|------------|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-23 | 66.0 | 72.956276 | 44.109070       | 101.803482      |
| 1   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-24 | 62.0 | 71.138611 | 40.761467       | 101.515747      |
| 2   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-25 | 40.0 | 68.140945 | 37.550083       | 98.731804       |
| 3   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-26 | 72.0 | 65.485588 | 34.841637       | 96.129539       |
| 4   | FOODS_3_586_CA_3 | 2016-05-27 | 69.0 | 64.961441 | 34.291973       | 95.630905       |


```python
mae = abs(res['y']-res['AutoARIMA']).mean()
print('The MAE with exogenous regressors is '+str(round(mae,2)))
```

``` text
The MAE with exogenous regressors is 11.42
```

To check whether the exogenous regressors were useful or not, we need to
generate the forecast again, now without them. To do this, we simple
pass the dataframe wihtout exogenous variables to the `forecast` method.
Notice that the data only includes `unique_id`, `ds`, and `y`. The
`forecast` method no longer requieres the future values of the exogenous
regressors `X_df`.


```python
# univariate model 
fcst_u = sf.forecast(df=train[['unique_id', 'ds', 'y']], h=28)

res_u = Y_test.merge(fcst_u, how='left', on=['unique_id', 'ds'])
mae_u = abs(res_u['y']-res_u['AutoARIMA']).mean()
```


```python
print('The MAE without exogenous regressors is '+str(round(mae_u,2)))
```

``` text
The MAE without exogenous regressors is 12.18
```

Hence, we can conclude that using `sell_price` and `snap_CA` as external
regressors helped improve the forecast.

title: Intermittent or Sparse Data

---

Intermittent or sparse data has very few non-zero observations. This
type of data is hard to forecast because the zero values increase the
uncertainty about the underlying patterns in the data. Furthermore, once
a non-zero observation occurs, there can be considerable variation in
its size. Intermittent time series are common in many industries,
including finance, retail, transportation, and energy. Given the
ubiquity of this type of series, special methods have been developed to
forecast them. The first was from [Croston (1972)](#ref), followed by
several variants and by different aggregation frameworks.

[StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/) has implemented
several models to forecast intermittent time series. By the end of this
tutorial, you’ll have a good understanding of these models and how to
use them.

**Outline:**

1.  Install libraries

done on Databricks.

</Tip>

## Install libraries

We assume that you have StatsForecast already installed. If not, check
this guide for instructions on [how to install
StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/installation.html)

Install the necessary packages using `pip install statsforecast`

```python
pip install statsforecast -U
```

## Load and explore the data

For this example, we’ll use a subset of the [M5
Competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0169207021001187#:~:text=the%20objective%20of%20the%20m5,the%20uncertainty%20around%20these%20forecasts)
dataset. Each time series represents the unit sales of a particular
product in a given Walmart store. At this level (product-store), most of
the data is intermittent. We first need to import the data, and to do
that, we’ll need
[datasetsforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/datasetsforecast/tree/main/).

```python
pip install datasetsforecast -U
```


```python
from datasetsforecast.m5 import M5
```

The function to load the data is `M5.load()`. It requieres the following
argument: - `directory`: (str) The directory where the data will be
downloaded.

This function returns multiple outputs, but only the first one with the
unit sales is needed.

```python
df_total, *_ = M5.load('./data')
```


```python
df_total.head()
```

|     | unique_id        | ds         | y   |
|-----|------------------|------------|-----|
| 0   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-01-29 | 3.0 |
| 1   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-01-30 | 0.0 |
| 2   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-01-31 | 0.0 |
| 3   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-02-01 | 1.0 |
| 4   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-02-02 | 4.0 |

From this dataset, we’ll select the first 8 time series. You can select
any number you want by changing the value of `n_series`.

```python
n_series = 8 
uids = df_total['unique_id'].unique()[:n_series]
df = df_total.query('unique_id in @uids')
```

We can plot these series using the `plot` method from the
[StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/core.html#statsforecast)
class. This method has multiple parameters, and the required ones to
generate the plots in this notebook are explained below.

-   `df`: A `pandas` dataframe with columns \[`unique_id`, `ds`, `y`\].
-   `forecasts_df`: A `pandas` dataframe with columns \[`unique_id`,
    `ds`\] and models.
-   `plot_random`: (bool = `True`) Plots the time series randomly.
-   `max_insample_length`: (int) The maximum number of train/insample
    observations to be plotted.
-   `engine`: (str = `plotly`). The library used to generate the plots.
    It can also be `matplotlib` for static plots.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
```


```python
StatsForecast.plot(df, plot_random = False, max_insample_length = 100)
```

![](/docs/tutorials/IntermittentData_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-9-output-2.png)

Here we only plotted the last 100 observations, but we can visualize the
complete history by removing `max_insample_length`. From these plots, we
can confirm that the data is indeed intermittent since it has multiple
periods with zero sales. In fact, in all cases but one, the median value
is zero.

```python
df.groupby('unique_id')[['y']].median().query('unique_id in @uids')
```

|                  | y   |
|------------------|-----|
| unique_id        |     |
| FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 0.0 |
| FOODS_1_001_CA_2 | 1.0 |
| FOODS_1_001_CA_3 | 0.0 |
| FOODS_1_001_CA_4 | 0.0 |
| FOODS_1_001_TX_1 | 0.0 |
| FOODS_1_001_TX_2 | 0.0 |
| FOODS_1_001_TX_3 | 0.0 |
| FOODS_1_001_WI_1 | 0.0 |

## Train models for intermittent data

Before training any model, we need to separate the data in a train and a
test set. The M5 Competition used the last 28 days as test set, so we’ll
do the same.

```python
dates = df['ds'].unique()[-28:] # last 28 days

train = df.query('ds not in @dates')
test = df.query('ds in @dates')
```

StatsForecast has efficient implementations of multiple models for
intermittent data. The complete list of models available is
[here](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#sparse-or-intermittent).
In this notebook, we’ll use:

-   [Agregate-Dissagregate Intermittent Demand Approach
    (ADIDA)](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#adida)
-   [Croston
    Classic](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#crostonclassic)
-   [Intermittent Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm
    (IMAPA)](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#imapa)
-   [Teunter-Syntetos-Babai
    (TSB)](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#tsb)

To use these models, we first need to import them from
`statsforecast.models` and then we need to instantiate them.

```python
from statsforecast.models import (
    ADIDA,
    CrostonClassic, 
    IMAPA, 
    TSB
)

# Create a list of models and instantiation parameters 
models = [
    ADIDA(), 
    CrostonClassic(), 
    IMAPA(), 
    TSB(alpha_d = 0.2, alpha_p = 0.2)
]
```

To instantiate a new StatsForecast object, we need the following
parameters:

-   `df`: The dataframe with the training data.
-   `models`: The list of models defined in the previous step.  
-   `freq`: A string indicating the frequency of the data. See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).
-   `n_jobs`: An integer that indicates the number of jobs used in
    parallel processing. Use -1 to select all cores.

```python
sf = StatsForecast(
    df = train, 
    models = models, 
    freq = 'D', 
    n_jobs = -1
)
```

Now we’re ready to generate the forecast. To do this, we’ll use the
[`forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/ets.html#forecast)
method, which requires the forecasting horizon (in this case, 28 days)
as argument.

The models for intermittent series that are currently available in
StatsForecast can only generate point-forecasts. If prediction intervals
are needed, then a [probabilisitic
model](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/#models) should be used.

```python
horizon = 28 
forecasts = sf.forecast(h=horizon)
forecasts = forecasts.reset_index()
forecasts.head()
```

|     | unique_id        | ds         | ADIDA    | CrostonClassic | IMAPA    | TSB      |
|-----|------------------|------------|----------|----------------|----------|----------|
| 0   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2016-05-23 | 0.791852 | 0.898247       | 0.705835 | 0.434313 |
| 1   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2016-05-24 | 0.791852 | 0.898247       | 0.705835 | 0.434313 |
| 2   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2016-05-25 | 0.791852 | 0.898247       | 0.705835 | 0.434313 |
| 3   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2016-05-26 | 0.791852 | 0.898247       | 0.705835 | 0.434313 |
| 4   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2016-05-27 | 0.791852 | 0.898247       | 0.705835 | 0.434313 |

Finally, we’ll merge the forecast with the actual values.

```python
test = test.merge(forecasts, how='left', on=['unique_id', 'ds'])
```

## Plot forecasts and compute accuracy

We can generate plots using the `plot` described above.

```python
StatsForecast.plot(train, test, plot_random = False, max_insample_length = 100)
```

![](/docs/tutorials/IntermittentData_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-16-output-1.png)

To compute the accuracy of the forecasts, we’ll use the Mean Average
Error (MAE), which is the sum of the absolute errors divided by the
number of forecasts. We’ll create a function to compute the MAE, and for
that, we’ll need to import `numpy`.

```python
import numpy as np 

def mae(y_hat, y_true):
    return np.mean(np.abs(y_hat-y_true))
```


```python
y_true = test['y'].values
adida_preds = test['ADIDA'].values
croston_preds = test['CrostonClassic'].values
imapa_preds = test['IMAPA'].values
tsb_preds = test['TSB'].values

print('ADIDA MAE: \t %0.3f' % mae(adida_preds, y_true))
print('Croston Classic MAE: \t %0.3f' % mae(croston_preds, y_true))
print('IMAPA MAE: \t %0.3f' % mae(imapa_preds, y_true))
print('TSB   MAE: \t %0.3f' % mae(tsb_preds, y_true))
```

``` text
ADIDA MAE:   0.949
Croston Classic MAE:     0.944
IMAPA MAE:   0.957
TSB   MAE:   1.023
```

Hence, on average, the forecasts are one unit off.

title: Detect Demand Peaks
---


## Introduction

Predicting peaks in different markets is useful. In the electricity
market, consuming electricity at peak demand is penalized with higher
tarifs. When an individual or company consumes electricity when its most
demanded, regulators calls that a coincident peak (CP).

In the Texas electricity market (ERCOT), the peak is the monthly
15-minute interval when the ERCOT Grid is at a point of highest
capacity. The peak is caused by all consumers’ combined demand on the
electrical grid. The coincident peak demand is an important factor used
by ERCOT to determine final electricity consumption bills. ERCOT
registers the CP demand of each client for 4 months, between June and
September, and uses this to adjust electricity prices. Clients can
therefore save on electricity bills by reducing the coincident peak
demand.

In this example we will train an
[`MSTL`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#mstl)
(Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) model on historic
load data to forecast day-ahead peaks on September 2022. Multiple
seasonality is traditionally present in low sampled electricity data.
Demand exhibits daily and weekly seasonality, with clear patterns for
specific hours of the day such as 6:00pm vs 3:00am or for specific days
such as Sunday vs Friday.

First, we will load ERCOT historic demand, then we will use the
[`StatsForecast.cross_validation`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.cross_validation)
method to fit the MSTL model and forecast daily load during September.
Finally, we show how to use the forecasts to detect the coincident peak.

## Libraries

We assume you have StatsForecast already installed. Check this guide for
instructions on [how to install StatsForecast](./installation.html).

Install the necessary packages using `pip install statsforecast`

## Load Data

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in [long
format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) with
three columns: `unique_id`, `ds` and `y`:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp or int) column should be either an integer
    indexing time or a datestamp ideally like YYYY-MM-DD for a date or
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```


```python
Y_df = pd.read_csv('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/ERCOT-clean.csv', parse_dates=['ds'])
```

Plot the series using the `plot` method from the
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
class. This method prints up to 8 random series from the dataset and is
useful for basic EDA.

> **Note**
>
> The `StatsForecast.plot` method uses Plotly as a default engine. You
> can change to MatPlotLib by setting `engine="matplotlib"`.


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
```


```python
StatsForecast.plot(Y_df)
```

We observe that the time series exhibits seasonal patterns. Moreover,
the time series contains `6,552` observations, so it is necessary to use
computationally efficient methods to deploy them in production.

## Fit and Forecast MSTL model

The MSTL (Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) model
decomposes the time series in multiple seasonalities using a Local
Polynomial Regression (LOESS). Then it forecasts the trend using a
custom non-seasonal model and each seasonality using a SeasonalNaive
model.

> **Tip**
>
> Check our detailed explanation and tutorial on MSTL
> [here](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/multipleseasonalities.html)

Import the
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
class and the models you need.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from utilsforecast.feature_engineering import trend

from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import MSTL, SklearnModel
```

First, instantiate the model and define the parameters. The electricity
load presents seasonalities every 24 hours (Hourly) and every 24 \* 7
(Daily) hours. Therefore, we will use `[24, 24 * 7]` as the
seasonalities. See [this
link](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) for a
detailed explanation on how to set seasonal lengths. In this example we
use the
[`SklearnModel`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#sklearnmodel)
with a `LinearRegression` model for the trend component, however, any
StatsForecast model can be used. The complete list of models is
available [here](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html).


```python
train, _ = trend(Y_df, freq='H')
train.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | y            | trend |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| 0   | ERCOT     | 2021-01-01 00:00:00 | 43719.849616 | 1.0   |
| 1   | ERCOT     | 2021-01-01 01:00:00 | 43321.050347 | 2.0   |
| 2   | ERCOT     | 2021-01-01 02:00:00 | 43063.067063 | 3.0   |
| 3   | ERCOT     | 2021-01-01 03:00:00 | 43090.059203 | 4.0   |
| 4   | ERCOT     | 2021-01-01 04:00:00 | 43486.590073 | 5.0   |


```python
models = [
    MSTL(
        season_length=[24, 24 * 7], # seasonalities of the time series 
        trend_forecaster=SklearnModel(LinearRegression()) # model used to forecast trend
    )
]
```

We fit the model by instantiating a
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
object with the following required parameters:

-   `models`: a list of models. Select the models you want from
    [models](../models.html) and import them.

-   `freq`: a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [panda’s
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)


```python
# Instantiate StatsForecast class as sf
sf = StatsForecast(
    models=models,
    freq='H', 
)
```

> **Tip**
>
> StatsForecast also supports this optional parameter.
>
> -   `n_jobs`: n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
>     processing, use -1 for all cores. (Default: 1)
>
> -   `fallback_model`: a model to be used if a model fails. (Default:
>     none)

The
[`cross_validation`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/mfles.html#cross_validation)
method allows the user to simulate multiple historic forecasts, greatly
simplifying pipelines by replacing for loops with `fit` and `predict`
methods. This method re-trains the model and forecast each window. See
[this
tutorial](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/getting_started_complete.html)
for an animation of how the windows are defined.

Use the
[`cross_validation`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/mfles.html#cross_validation)
method to produce all the daily forecasts for September. To produce
daily forecasts set the forecasting horizon `h` as 24. In this example
we are simulating deploying the pipeline during September, so set the
number of windows as 30 (one for each day). Finally, set the step size
between windows as 24, to only produce one forecast per day.


```python
cv_df = sf.cross_validation(
    df=train,
    h=24,
    step_size=24,
    n_windows=30
  )
```


```python
cv_df.head()
```

|  | unique_id | ds | cutoff | y | MSTL |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | ERCOT | 2022-09-01 00:00:00 | 2022-08-31 23:00:00 | 45482.471757 | 47413.944185 |
| 1 | ERCOT | 2022-09-01 01:00:00 | 2022-08-31 23:00:00 | 43602.658043 | 45237.153285 |
| 2 | ERCOT | 2022-09-01 02:00:00 | 2022-08-31 23:00:00 | 42284.817342 | 43816.390019 |
| 3 | ERCOT | 2022-09-01 03:00:00 | 2022-08-31 23:00:00 | 41663.156771 | 42972.956286 |
| 4 | ERCOT | 2022-09-01 04:00:00 | 2022-08-31 23:00:00 | 41710.621904 | 42909.899438 |

## Peak Detection

Finally, we use the forecasts in `cv_df` to detect the daily hourly
demand peaks. For each day, we set the detected peaks as the highest
forecasts. In this case, we want to predict one peak (`npeaks`);
depending on your setting and goals, this parameter might change. For
example, the number of peaks can correspond to how many hours a battery
can be discharged to reduce demand.


```python
npeaks = 1 # Number of peaks
```

For the ERCOT 4CP detection task we are interested in correctly
predicting the highest monthly load. Next, we filter the day in
September with the highest hourly demand and predict the peak.


```python
cv_df = cv_df[['ds','y','MSTL']]
max_day = cv_df.iloc[cv_df['y'].argmax()].ds.day # Day with maximum load
cv_df_day = cv_df.query('ds.dt.day == @max_day')
max_hour = cv_df_day['y'].argmax()
peaks = cv_df_day['MSTL'].argsort().iloc[-npeaks:].values # Predicted peaks
```

In the following plot we see how the MSTL model is able to correctly
detect the coincident peak for September 2022.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.axvline(cv_df_day.iloc[max_hour]['ds'], color='black', label='True Peak')
plt.scatter(cv_df_day.iloc[peaks]['ds'], cv_df_day.iloc[peaks]['MSTL'], color='green', label=f'Predicted Top-{npeaks}')
plt.plot(cv_df_day['ds'], cv_df_day['y'], label='y', color='blue')
plt.plot(cv_df_day['ds'], cv_df_day['MSTL'], label='Forecast', color='red')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Load (MW)')
plt.grid()
plt.legend()
```

## Next steps

StatsForecast and MSTL in particular are good benchmarking models for
peak detection. However, it might be useful to explore further and newer
forecasting algorithms. We have seen particularly good results with the
N-HiTS, a deep-learning model from Nixtla’s NeuralForecast library.

model and the NeuralForecast library in [this

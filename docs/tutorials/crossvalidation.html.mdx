## Introduction

Time series cross-validation is a method for evaluating how a model
would have performed in the past. It works by defining a sliding window
across the historical data and predicting the period following it.

[Statsforecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/) has an
implementation of time series cross-validation that is fast and easy to
use. This implementation makes cross-validation a distributed operation,
which makes it less time-consuming. In this notebook, we’ll use it on a
subset of the [M4
Competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301128)
hourly dataset.

**Outline:**

1.  Install libraries
2.  Load and explore data
3.  Train model
4.  Perform time series cross-validation
5.  Evaluate results

## Install libraries

We assume that you have StatsForecast already installed. If not, check
this guide for instructions on [how to install
StatsForecast]('https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/installation.html')

Install the necessary packages with `pip install statsforecast`


```python
pip install statsforecast
```


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast # required to instantiate StastForecast object and use cross-validation method
```

## Load and explore the data

As stated in the introduction, we’ll use the M4 Competition hourly
dataset. We’ll first import the data from an URL using `pandas`.


```python
import pandas as pd
```


```python
Y_df = pd.read_parquet('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/m4-hourly.parquet') # load the data 
Y_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | y     |
|-----|-----------|-----|-------|
| 0   | H1        | 1   | 605.0 |
| 1   | H1        | 2   | 586.0 |
| 2   | H1        | 3   | 586.0 |
| 3   | H1        | 4   | 559.0 |
| 4   | H1        | 5   | 511.0 |

The input to
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
is a data frame in [long
format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) with
three columns: `unique_id`, `ds` and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int, or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.
-   The `ds` (datestamp or int) column should be either an integer
    indexing time or a datestamp in format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD
    HH:MM:SS.
-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

The data in this example already has this format, so no changes are
needed.

To keep the time required to execute this notebook to a minimum, we’ll
only use one time series from the data, namely the one with
`unique_id == 'H1'`. However, you can use as many as you want, with no
additional changes to the code needed.


```python
df = Y_df[Y_df['unique_id'] == 'H1'] # select time series
```

We can plot the time series we’ll work with using `StatsForecast.plot`
method.


```python
StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

## Train model

For this example, we’ll use StastForecast
[AutoETS](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#autoets).
We first need to import it from `statsforecast.models` and then we need
to instantiate a new
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
object.

The
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
object has the following parameters:

-   models: a list of models. Select the models you want from
    [models](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html) and
    import them.
-   freq: a string indicating the frequency of the data. See [panda’s
    available
    frequencies.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases)
-   n_jobs: n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel processing,
    use -1 for all cores.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame `df`.


```python
from statsforecast.models import AutoETS
```


```python
models = [AutoETS(season_length = 24)]

sf = StatsForecast(
    models = models, 
    freq = 1, 
    n_jobs = 1
)
```

## Perform time series cross-validation

Once the
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)object
has been instantiated, we can use the
[`cross_validation`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/mfles.html#cross_validation)
method, which takes the following arguments:

-   `df`: training data frame with
    [`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
    format
-   `h` (int): represents the h steps into the future that will be
    forecasted
-   `step_size` (int): step size between each window, meaning how often
    do you want to run the forecasting process.
-   `n_windows` (int): number of windows used for cross-validation,
    meaning the number of forecasting processes in the past you want to
    evaluate.

For this particular example, we’ll use 3 windows of 24 hours.


```python
cv_df = sf.cross_validation(
    df = df,
    h = 24,
    step_size = 24,
    n_windows = 3
  )
```

The `cv_df` object is a new data frame that includes the following
columns:

-   `unique_id`: series identifier
-   `ds`: datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff`: the last datestamp or temporal index for the n_windows.
-   `y`: true value
-   `"model"`: columns with the model’s name and fitted value.


```python
cv_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | cutoff | y     | AutoETS    |
|-----|-----------|-----|--------|-------|------------|
| 0   | H1        | 677 | 676    | 691.0 | 677.761053 |
| 1   | H1        | 678 | 676    | 618.0 | 607.817879 |
| 2   | H1        | 679 | 676    | 563.0 | 569.437729 |
| 3   | H1        | 680 | 676    | 529.0 | 537.340007 |
| 4   | H1        | 681 | 676    | 504.0 | 515.571123 |

We’ll now plot the forecast for each cutoff period. To make the plots
clearer, we’ll rename the actual values in each period.


```python
from IPython.display import display
```


```python
cv_df.rename(columns = {'y' : 'actual'}, inplace = True) # rename actual values 

cutoff = cv_df['cutoff'].unique()

for k in range(len(cutoff)): 
    cv = cv_df[cv_df['cutoff'] == cutoff[k]]
    display(StatsForecast.plot(df, cv.loc[:, cv.columns != 'cutoff']))
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/tutorials/CrossValidation_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-13-output-3.png)

Notice that in each cutoff period, we generated a forecast for the next
24 hours using only the data `y` before said period.

## Evaluate results

We can now compute the accuracy of the forecast using an appropiate
accuracy metric. Here we’ll use the [Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation).


```python
from utilsforecast.losses import rmse
```

The function to compute the RMSE takes two arguments:

1.  The actual values.  
2.  The forecasts, in this case,
    [`AutoETS`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoets).


```python
cv_rmse = rmse(cv_df, models=['AutoETS'], target_col='actual')['AutoETS'].item()
print(f"RMSE using cross-validation: {cv_rmse:.2f}")
```

``` text
RMSE using cross-validation: 33.90
```

This measure should better reflect the predictive abilities of our
model, since it used different time periods to test its accuracy.

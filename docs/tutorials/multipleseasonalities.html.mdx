Multiple seasonal data refers to time series that have more than one
clear seasonality. Multiple seasonality is traditionally present in data
that is sampled at a low frequency. For example, hourly electricity data
exhibits daily and weekly seasonality. That means that there are clear
patterns of electricity consumption for specific hours of the day like
6:00pm vs 3:00am or for specific days like Sunday vs Friday.

Traditional statistical models are not able to model more than one
seasonal length. In this example, we will show how to model the two
seasonalities efficiently using Multiple Seasonal-Trend decompositions
with LOESS
([`MSTL`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#mstl)).

For this example, we will use hourly electricity load data from
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (PJM). The original data can be
found
[here](https://github.com/jnagura/Energy-consumption-prediction-analysis).
(Click here for info on [PJM](https://www.pjm.com/about-pjm))

First, we will load the data, then we will use the `StatsForecast.fit`
and `StatsForecast.predict` methods to predict the next 24 hours. We
will then decompose the different elements of the time series into
trends and its multiple seasonalities. At the end, you will use the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
for production-ready forecasting.

## Install libraries

We assume you have StatsForecast already installed. Check this guide for
instructions on [how to install StatsForecast](./installation.html).

Install the necessary packages using `pip install statsforecast` \`\`

## Load Data

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in [long
format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) with
three columns: `unique_id`, `ds` and `y`:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp or int) column should be either an integer
    indexing time or a datestamp ideally like YYYY-MM-DD for a date or
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast. We
    will rename the

You will read the data with pandas and change the necessary names. This
step should take around 2s.

```python
import pandas as pd
```


```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panambY/Hourly_Energy_Consumption/master/data/PJM_Load_hourly.csv')
df.columns = ['ds', 'y']
df.insert(0, 'unique_id', 'PJM_Load_hourly')
df = df.sort_values(['unique_id', 'ds']).reset_index(drop=True)
df.tail()
```

|       | unique_id       | ds                  | y       |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| 32891 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2001-12-31 20:00:00 | 36392.0 |
| 32892 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2001-12-31 21:00:00 | 35082.0 |
| 32893 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2001-12-31 22:00:00 | 33890.0 |
| 32894 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2001-12-31 23:00:00 | 32590.0 |
| 32895 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2002-01-01 00:00:00 | 31569.0 |

StatsForecast can handle unsorted data, however, for plotting purposes,
it is convenient to sort the data frame.

Plot the series using the `plot` method from the
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
class. This method prints up to 8 random series from the dataset and is
useful for basic EDA. In this case, it will print just one series given
that we have just one unique_id.

> **Note**
>
> The `StatsForecast.plot` method uses matplotlib as a default engine.
> You can change to plotly by setting `engine="plotly"`.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
```


```python
StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

The time series exhibits seasonal patterns. Moreover, the time series
contains `32,896` observations, so it is necessary to use very
computationally efficient methods.

## Fit an MSTL model

The
[`MSTL`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#mstl)
(Multiple Seasonal-Trend decompositions using LOESS) model, originally
developed by [Kasun Bandara, Rob J Hyndman and Christoph
Bergmeir](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13462), decomposes the time series
in multiple seasonalities using a Local Polynomial Regression (LOESS).
Then it forecasts the trend using a non-seasonal model and each
seasonality using a
[`SeasonalNaive`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#seasonalnaive)
model. You can choose the non-seasonal model you want to use to forecast
the trend component of the MSTL model. In this example, we will use an
AutoARIMA.

Import the models you need.

```python
from statsforecast.models import MSTL, AutoARIMA
```

First, we must define the model parameters. As mentioned before, the
electricity load presents seasonalities every 24 hours (Hourly) and
every 24 \* 7 (Daily) hours. Therefore, we will use `[24, 24 * 7]` for
season length. The trend component will be forecasted with an
[`AutoARIMA`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoarima)
model. (You can also try with:
[`AutoTheta`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autotheta),
[`AutoCES`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoces),
and
[`AutoETS`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoets))

```python
# Create a list of models and instantiation parameters

models = [MSTL(
    season_length=[24, 24 * 7], # seasonalities of the time series 
    trend_forecaster=AutoARIMA() # model used to forecast trend
)]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
object with the following required parameters:

-   `models`: a list of models. Select the models you want from
    [models](../models.html) and import them.

-   `freq`: a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [panda’s
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.

```python
sf = StatsForecast(
    models=models, # model used to fit each time series 
    freq='h', # frequency of the data
)
```

> **Tip**
>
> StatsForecast also supports this optional parameter.
>
> -   `n_jobs`: n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
>     processing, use -1 for all cores. (Default: 1)
>
> -   `fallback_model`: a model to be used if a model fails. (Default:
>     none)

Use the `fit` method to fit each model to each time series. In this
case, we are just fitting one model to one series. Check this guide to
learn how to [fit many models to many
series](./getting_started_complete.html).

> **Note**
>
> StatsForecast achieves its blazing speed using JIT compiling through
> Numba. The first time you call the statsforecast class, the fit method
> should take around 10 seconds. The second time -once Numba compiled
> your settings- it should take less than 5s.

```python
sf = sf.fit(df=df)
```

## Decompose the series

Once the model is fitted, access the decomposition using the `fitted_`
attribute of
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast).
This attribute stores all relevant information of the fitted models for
each of the time series.

In this case, we are fitting a single model for a single time series, so
by accessing the fitted\_ location \[0, 0\] we will find the relevant
information of our model. The
[`MSTL`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#mstl)
class generates a `model_` attribute that contains the way the series
was decomposed.

```python
sf.fitted_[0, 0].model_
```

|       | data    | trend        | seasonal24   | seasonal168 | remainder    |
|-------|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 0     | 22259.0 | 25899.808157 | -4720.213546 | 581.308595  | 498.096794   |

We will use matplotlib, to visualize the different components of the
series.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
sf.fitted_[0, 0].model_.tail(24 * 28).plot(subplots=True, grid=True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/tutorials/MultipleSeasonalities_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-12-output-1.png)

We observe a clear upward trend (orange line) and seasonality repeating
every day (24H) and every week (168H).

## Predict the next 24 hours

> Probabilistic forecasting with levels

To generate forecasts use the `predict` method.

The `predict` method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h` (int): represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level` (list of floats): this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the `level` (or confidence
    percentile) of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]`
    means that the model expects the real value to be inside that
    interval 90% of the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.

```python
forecasts = sf.predict(h=24, level=[90])
forecasts.head()
```

|  | unique_id | ds | MSTL | MSTL-lo-90 | MSTL-hi-90 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2002-01-01 01:00:00 | 30215.608123 | 29842.185581 | 30589.030664 |

| 2 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2002-01-01 03:00:00 | 29132.786369 | 28221.353220 | 30044.219518 |
| 3 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2002-01-01 04:00:00 | 29126.252713 | 27992.819671 | 30259.685756 |
| 4 | PJM_Load_hourly | 2002-01-01 05:00:00 | 29604.606314 | 28273.426621 | 30935.786006 |

You can plot the forecast by calling the `StatsForecast.plot` method and
passing in your forecast dataframe.

```python
sf.plot(df, forecasts, max_insample_length=24 * 7)
```

## Forecast in production

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The `forecast` method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h` (int): represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level` (list of floats): this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the `level` (or confidence
    percentile) of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]`
    means that the model expects the real value to be inside that
    interval 90% of the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min. (If you want to speed things up to a couple of seconds,
remove the AutoModels like ARIMA and Theta)

```python
forecasts_df = sf.forecast(df=df, h=24, level=[90])
forecasts_df.head()

title: Forecasting at Scale using ETS and ray (M5)
---


In this notebook we show how to use
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
and `ray` to forecast thounsands of time series in less than 6 minutes
(M5 dataset). Also, we show that
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
has better performance in time and accuracy compared to [`Prophet`
running on a Spark
cluster](http:nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/Prophet_spark_m5.html)
using DataBricks.

In this example, we used a ray cluster (AWS) of 11 instances of type
m5.2xlarge (8 cores, 32 GB RAM).

## Installing StatsForecast Library


```python
!pip install "statsforecast[ray]" neuralforecast s3fs pyarrow
```


```python
from time import time

import pandas as pd
from neuralforecast.data.datasets.m5 import M5, M5Evaluation
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import ETS
```

## Download data

The example uses the [M5
dataset](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M5-methods/blob/master/M5-Competitors-Guide.pdf).
It consists of `30,490` bottom time series.


```python
Y_df = pd.read_parquet('s3://m5-benchmarks/data/train/target.parquet')
Y_df = Y_df.rename(columns={
    'item_id': 'unique_id', 
    'timestamp': 'ds', 
    'demand': 'y'
})
Y_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(Y_df['ds'])
```


```python
Y_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id        | ds         | y   |
|-----|------------------|------------|-----|
| 0   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-01-29 | 3.0 |
| 1   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-01-30 | 0.0 |
| 2   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-01-31 | 0.0 |
| 3   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-02-01 | 1.0 |
| 4   | FOODS_1_001_CA_1 | 2011-02-02 | 4.0 |

Since the M5 dataset contains intermittent time series, we add a
constant to avoid problems during the training phase. Later, we will
substract the constant from the forecasts.


```python
constant = 10
Y_df['y'] += constant
```

## Train the model

[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
receives a list of models to fit each time series. Since we are dealing
with Daily data, it would be benefitial to use 7 as seasonality. Observe
that we need to pass the ray address to the `ray_address` argument.


```python
fcst = StatsForecast(
    df=Y_df, 
    models=[ETS(season_length=7, model='ZNA')], 
    freq='D', 
    #n_jobs=-1
    ray_address='ray://ADDRESS:10001'
)
```


```python
init = time()
Y_hat = fcst.forecast(28)
end = time()
print(f'Minutes taken by StatsForecast using: {(end - init) / 60}')
```

This can be slow on Ray Client due to communication overhead over the network. If you're running many fine-grained tasks, consider running them inside a single remote function. See the section on "Too fine-grained tasks" in the Ray Design Patterns document for more details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/167rnnDFIVRhHhK4mznEIemOtj63IOhtIPvSYaPgI4Fg/edit#heading=h.f7ins22n6nyl. If your functions frequently use large objects, consider storing the objects remotely with ray.put. An example of this is shown in the "Closure capture of large / unserializable object" section of the Ray Design Patterns document, available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/167rnnDFIVRhHhK4mznEIemOtj63IOhtIPvSYaPgI4Fg/edit#heading=h.1afmymq455wu

Minutes taken by StatsForecast using: 5.4817593971888225
```

[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
and `ray` took only 5.48 minutes to train `30,490` time series, compared
to 18.23 minutes for Prophet and Spark.

We remove the constant.


```python
Y_hat['ETS'] -= constant
```

### Evaluating performance

The M5 competition used the weighted root mean squared scaled error. You
can find details of the metric
[here](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M5-methods/blob/master/M5-Competitors-Guide.pdf).


```python
Y_hat = Y_hat.reset_index().set_index(['unique_id', 'ds']).unstack()
Y_hat = Y_hat.droplevel(0, 1).reset_index()
```


```python
*_, S_df = M5.load('./data')
Y_hat = S_df.merge(Y_hat, how='left', on=['unique_id'])
```

```


```python
M5Evaluation.evaluate(y_hat=Y_hat, directory='./data')
```

| Level10 | 1.013124 |

| Level12 | 0.916175 |

Also,
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
is more accurate than Prophet, since the overall WMRSSE is `0.68`,
against `0.77` obtained by prophet.

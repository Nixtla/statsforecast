[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
follows the sklearn model API. For this minimal example, you will create
an instance of the StatsForecast class and then call its `fit` and
`predict` methods. We recommend this option if speed is not paramount
and you want to explore the fitted values and parameters.

<Tip>

If you want to forecast many series, we recommend using the
[`forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/ets.html#forecast)
method. Check this [Getting Started with multiple time
series](./getting_started_complete.html) guide.

</Tip>

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in [long
format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) with
three columns: `unique_id`, `ds` and `y`:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

As an example, let’s look at the US Air Passengers dataset. This time
series consists of monthly totals of a US airline passengers from 1949
to 1960. The CSV is available
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chirag19/air-passengers).

We assume you have StatsForecast already installed. Check this guide for
instructions on [how to install StatsForecast](./installation.html).

First, we’ll import the data:

```python
# uncomment the following line to install the library
# %pip install statsforecast
```


```python
import os

import pandas as pd
```


```python
# this makes it so that the outputs of the predict methods have the id as a column 
# instead of as the index
os.environ['NIXTLA_ID_AS_COL'] = '1'
```


```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/air-passengers.csv', parse_dates=['ds'])
df.head()
```

|     | unique_id     | ds         | y   |
|-----|---------------|------------|-----|
| 0   | AirPassengers | 1949-01-01 | 112 |
| 1   | AirPassengers | 1949-02-01 | 118 |
| 2   | AirPassengers | 1949-03-01 | 132 |
| 3   | AirPassengers | 1949-04-01 | 129 |
| 4   | AirPassengers | 1949-05-01 | 121 |

We fit the model by instantiating a new
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
object with its two required parameters:
https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html \* `models`:
a list of models. Select the models you want from
[models](../../src/core/models.html) and import them. For this example,
we will use a
[`AutoARIMA`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoarima)
model. We set `season_length` to 12 because we expect seasonal effects
every 12 months. (See: [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/))

-   `freq`: a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [pandas
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.

<Note>

StatsForecast achieves its blazing speed using JIT compiling through
Numba. The first time you call the statsforecast class, the fit method
should take around 5 seconds. The second time -once Numba compiled your
settings- it should take less than 0.2s.

</Note>

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA

sf = StatsForecast(
    models=[AutoARIMA(season_length = 12)],
    freq='M',
)

sf.fit(df)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[AutoARIMA])
```

The `predict` method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h` (int): represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level` (list of floats): this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the `level` (or confidence
    percentile) of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]`
    means that the model expects the real value to be inside that
    interval 90% of the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

```python
forecast_df = sf.predict(h=12, level=[90])
forecast_df.tail()
```

|     | unique_id     | ds         | AutoARIMA  | AutoARIMA-lo-90 | AutoARIMA-hi-90 |
|-----|---------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 7   | AirPassengers | 1961-07-31 | 633.230774 | 589.562378      | 676.899170      |
| 8   | AirPassengers | 1961-08-31 | 535.230774 | 489.082153      | 581.379456      |
| 9   | AirPassengers | 1961-09-30 | 488.230804 | 439.728699      | 536.732910      |
| 10  | AirPassengers | 1961-10-31 | 417.230804 | 366.484253      | 467.977356      |
| 11  | AirPassengers | 1961-11-30 | 459.230804 | 406.334930      | 512.126648      |

You can plot the forecast by calling the `StatsForecast.plot` method and
passing in your forecast dataframe.

```python
sf.plot(df, forecast_df, level=[90])
```

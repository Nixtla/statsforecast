#### Extras

The following features can also be installed by specifying the extra
inside the install command,
e.g. `pip install 'statsforecast[extra1,extra2]'`

-   **polars**: provide polars dataframes to StatsForecast.
-   **plotly**: use `StatsForecast.plot` with the plotly backend.

#### Development version

If you want to try out a new feature that hasn’t made it into a release
yet you have the following options:

-   Install from our nightly wheels:
    `pip install --extra-index-url=http://nixtla-packages.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com --trusted-host nixtla-packages.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com statsforecast`
-   Install from github:
    `pip install git+https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast`. This
    requires that you have a C++ compiler installed, so we encourage you
    to try the previous option first.

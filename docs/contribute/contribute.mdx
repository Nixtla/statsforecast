---


Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nixtla. Nixtla is free,
open-source software and welcomes all types of contributions, including
documentation changes, bug reports, bug fixes, or new source code
changes.

## Contribution issues 🔧

Most of the issues that are open for contributions will be tagged with
`good first issue` or `help wanted`. A great place to start looking will
be our GitHub projects for:

-   Community writers
    [dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/Nixtla/projects/9).
-   Community code contributors
    [dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/Nixtla/projects/6).

Also, we are always open to suggestions so feel free to open new issues
with your ideas and we can give you guidance!

After you find the issue that you want to contribute to, follow the
`fork-and-pull` workflow:

1.  Fork the Nixtla repository you want to work on (e.g. StatsForecast
    or NeuralForecast)
2.  Clone the repository locally (`git clone`) and create a new branch
    (`git checkout -b my-new-branch`)
3.  Make changes and commit them
4.  Push your local branch to your fork
5.  Submit a Pull Request so that we can review your changes
6.  Write a commit message
7.  Make sure that the CI tests are GREEN (CI tests refer to automated
    tests that are run on code changes to ensure that new additions or
    modifications do not introduce new errors or break existing
    functionality.)

Be sure to merge the latest from “upstream” before making a Pull
Request!

You can find a complete step-by-step guide on this `fork-and-pull`
workflow

Pull Request reviews are done on a regular basis. Please make sure you
respond to our feedback/questions and sign our CLA.

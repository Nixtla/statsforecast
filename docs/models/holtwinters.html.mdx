## Introduction<a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

The Holt-Winter model, also known as the triple exponential smoothing
method, is a forecasting technique widely used in time series analysis.
It was developed by Charles Holt and Peter Winters in 1960 as an
improvement on Holt’s double exponential smoothing method.

The Holt-Winter model is used to predict future values of a time series
that exhibits a trend and seasonality. The model uses three smoothing
parameters, one for estimating the trend, another for estimating the
level or base level of the time series, and another for estimating
seasonality. These parameters are called α, β and γ, respectively.

The Holt-Winter model is an extension of Holt’s double exponential
smoothing method, which uses only two smoothing parameters to estimate
the trend and base level of the time series. The Holt-Winter model
improves the accuracy of the forecasts by adding a third smoothing
parameter for seasonality.

One of the main advantages of the Holt-Winter model is that it is easy
to implement and does not require a large amount of historical data to
generate accurate predictions. Furthermore, the model is highly
adaptable and can be customized to fit a wide variety of time series
with seasonality.

However, the Holt-Winter model has some limitations. For example, the
model assumes that the time series is stationary and that seasonality is
constant. If the time series is not stationary or has non-constant
seasonality, the Holt-Winter model may not be the most appropriate.

In general, the Holt-Winter model is a useful and widely used technique
in time series analysis, especially when the series is expected to
exhibit a constant trend and seasonality.

## Holt-Winters Method <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

The Holt-Winters seasonal method comprises the forecast equation and
three smoothing equations — one for the level $\ell_{t}$, one for the
trend $b_t$, and one for the seasonal component $s_t$ , with
corresponding smoothing parameters $\alpha$ , $\beta^*$ and $\gamma$. We
use $m$ to denote the period of the seasonality, i.e., the number of
seasons in a year. For example, for quarterly data $m=4$, and for
monthly data $m=12$.

There are two variations to this method that differ in the nature of the
seasonal component. The additive method is preferred when the seasonal
variations are roughly constant through the series, while the
multiplicative method is preferred when the seasonal variations are
changing proportional to the level of the series. With the additive
method, the seasonal component is expressed in absolute terms in the
scale of the observed series, and in the level equation the series is
seasonally adjusted by subtracting the seasonal component. Within each
year, the seasonal component will add up to approximately zero. With the
multiplicative method, the seasonal component is expressed in relative
terms (percentages), and the series is seasonally adjusted by dividing
through by the seasonal component. Within each year, the seasonal
component will sum up to approximately $m$.

### Holt-Winters’ additive method

Holt-Winters’ additive method is a time series forecasting technique
that extends the Holt-Winters’ method by incorporating an additive
seasonality component. It is suitable for time series data that exhibit
a seasonal pattern that changes over time.

The Holt-Winters’ additive method uses three smoothing parameters -
alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) - to estimate the level, trend, and
seasonal components of the time series. The alpha parameter controls the
smoothing of the level component, the beta parameter controls the
smoothing of the trend component, and the gamma parameter controls the
smoothing of the additive seasonal component.

The forecasting process involves three steps: first, the level, trend,
and seasonal components are estimated using the smoothing parameters and
the historical data; second, these components are used to forecast
future values of the time series; and third, the forecasted values are
adjusted for the seasonal component using an additive factor.

One of the advantages of Holt-Winters’ additive method is that it can
handle time series data with an additive seasonality component, which is
common in many real-world applications. The method is also easy to
implement and can be extended to handle time series data with changing
seasonal patterns.

However, the method has some limitations. It assumes that the
seasonality pattern is additive, which may not be the case for all time
series. Additionally, the method requires a sufficient amount of
historical data to accurately estimate the smoothing parameters and the
seasonal component.

Overall, Holt-Winters’ additive method is a powerful and widely used
forecasting technique that can be used to generate accurate predictions
for time series data with an additive seasonality component. The method
is easy to implement and can be extended to handle time series data with
changing seasonal patterns.

The component form for the additive method is:

where $k$ is the integer part of $(h-1)/m$, which ensures that the
estimates of the seasonal indices used for forecasting come from the
final year of the sample. The level equation shows a weighted average
between the seasonally adjusted observation $(y_{t} - s_{t-m})$ and the
non-seasonal forecast $(\ell_{t-1}+b_{t-1})$ for time $t$. The trend
equation is identical to Holt’s linear method. The seasonal equation
shows a weighted average between the current seasonal index,
$(y_{t}-\ell_{t-1}-b_{t-1})$, and the seasonal index of the same season
last year (i.e., $m$ time periods ago).

The equation for the seasonal component is often expressed as

$$s_{t} = \gamma^* (y_{t}-\ell_{t})+ (1-\gamma^*)s_{t-m}.$$

If we substitute $\ell_{t}$ from the smoothing equation for the level of
the component form above, we get

$$s_{t} = \gamma^*(1-\alpha) (y_{t}-\ell_{t-1}-b_{t-1})+ [1-\gamma^*(1-\alpha)]s_{t-m},$$

which is identical to the smoothing equation for the seasonal component
we specify here, with $\gamma=\gamma^*(1-\alpha)$. The usual parameter
restriction is $0\le\gamma^*\le1$, which translates to
$0\le\gamma\le 1-\alpha$.

### Holt-Winters’ multiplicative method

The Holt-Winters’ multiplicative method uses three smoothing
parameters - alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) - to estimate the level,
trend, and seasonal components of the time series. The alpha parameter
controls the smoothing of the level component, the beta parameter
controls the smoothing of the trend component, and the gamma parameter
controls the smoothing of the multiplicative seasonal component.

The forecasting process involves three steps: first, the level, trend,
and seasonal components are estimated using the smoothing parameters and
the historical data; second, these components are used to forecast
future values of the time series; and third, the forecasted values are
adjusted for the seasonal component using a multiplicative factor.

One of the advantages of Holt-Winters’ multiplicative method is that it
can handle time series data with a multiplicative seasonality component,
which is common in many real-world applications. The method is also easy
to implement and can be extended to handle time series data with
changing seasonal patterns.

However, the method has some limitations. It assumes that the
seasonality pattern is multiplicative, which may not be the case for all
time series. Additionally, the method requires a sufficient amount of
historical data to accurately estimate the smoothing parameters and the
seasonal component.

Overall, Holt-Winters’ multiplicative method is a powerful and widely
used forecasting technique that can be used to generate accurate
predictions for time series data with a multiplicative seasonality
component. The method is easy to implement and can be extended to handle
time series data with changing seasonal patterns.

In the multiplicative version, the seasonality averages to one. Use the
multiplicative method if the seasonal variation increases with the
level.

### Mathematical models in the ETS taxonomy

I hope that it becomes more apparent to the reader how the ETS framework
is built upon the idea of time series decomposition. By introducing
different components, defining their types, and adding the equations for
their update, we can construct models that would work better in
capturing the key features of the time series. But we should also
consider the potential change in components over time. The “transition”
or “state” equations are supposed to reflect this change: they explain
how the level, trend or seasonal components evolve.

As discussed in Section 2.2, given different types of components and
their interactions, we end up with 30 models in the taxonomy. Tables 1
and 2 summarise mathematically all 30 ETS models shown graphically on
Figures 1 and 2, presenting formulae for measurement and transition
equations.

From a statistical point of view, formulae in Tables 1 and 2 correspond
to the “true models”, they explain the models underlying potential data,
but when it comes to their construction and estimation, the $\epsilon_t$
is substituted by the estimated $e_t$ (which is calculated differently
depending on the error type), and time series components and smoothing
parameters are also replaced by their estimates (e.g. $\hat \alpha$
instead of $\alpha$). However, if the values of these models’ parameters
were known, it would be possible to produce point forecasts and
conditional h steps ahead expectations from these models.

### Model selection

A great advantage of the `Holt Winters` statistical framework is that
information criteria can be used for model selection. The `AIC, AIC_c`
and `BIC`, can be used here to determine which of the `Holt Winters`
models is most appropriate for a given time series.

For `Holt Winters` models, Akaike’s Information Criterion (`AIC)` is
defined as

$$\text{AIC} = -2\log(L) + 2k,$$

where $L$ is the likelihood of the model and $k$ is the total number of
parameters and initial states that have been estimated (including the
residual variance).

The `AIC` corrected for small sample bias `(AIC_c)` is defined as

$$AIC_c = AIC + \frac{2k(k+1)}{T-k-1}$$

and the Bayesian Information Criterion `(BIC)` is

$$\text{BIC} = \text{AIC} + k[\log(T)-2]$$

Three of the combinations of (Error, Trend, Seasonal) can lead to
numerical difficulties. Specifically, the models that can cause such
instabilities are `ETS(A,N,M), ETS(A,A,M)`, and `ETS(A,Ad,M)`, due to
division by values potentially close to zero in the state equations. We
normally do not consider these particular combinations when selecting a
model.

Models with multiplicative errors are useful when the data are strictly
positive, but are not numerically stable when the data contain zeros or
negative values. Therefore, multiplicative error models will not be
considered if the time series is not strictly positive. In that case,
only the six fully additive models will be applied.

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds                  | y      | unique_id |
|-----|---------------------|--------|-----------|

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds           object
y             int64
unique_id    object

```

We can see that our time variable `(ds)` is in an object format, we need
to convert to a date format

```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

### The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a type of statistical test that
determines whether a unit root is present in time series data. Unit
roots can cause unpredictable results in time series analysis. A null
hypothesis is formed in the unit root test to determine how strongly
time series data is affected by a trend. By accepting the null
hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data is not
stationary. By rejecting the null hypothesis or accepting the
alternative hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data
is generated by a stationary process. This process is also known as
stationary trend. The values of the ADF test statistic are negative.
Lower ADF values indicate a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis.

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test is a common statistical test used to test
whether a given time series is stationary or not. We can achieve this by
defining the null and alternate hypothesis.

-   Null Hypothesis: Time Series is non-stationary. It gives a
    time-dependent trend.

-   Alternate Hypothesis: Time Series is stationary. In another term,
    the series doesn’t depend on time.

-   ADF or t Statistic \< critical values: Reject the null hypothesis,
    time series is stationary.

-   ADF or t Statistic \> critical values: Failed to reject the null
    hypothesis, time series is non-stationary.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

def Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_func(series , column_name):
    print (f'Dickey-Fuller test results for columns: {column_name}')
    dftest = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    dfoutput = pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['Test Statistic','p-value','No Lags Used','Number of observations used'])
    for key,value in dftest[4].items():

### Autocorrelation plots

**Autocorrelation Function**

**Definition 1.** Let $\{x_t;1 ≤ t ≤ n\}$ be a time series sample of
size n from $\{X_t\}$. 1. $\bar x = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{x_t}{n}$ is
called the sample mean of $\{X_t\}$. 2.
$c_k =\sum_{t=1}^{n−k} (x_{t+k}- \bar x)(x_t−\bar x)/n$ is known as the
sample autocovariance function of $\{X_t\}$. 3. $r_k = c_k /c_0$ is said
to be the sample autocorrelation function of $\{X_t\}$.

Note the following remarks about this definition:

-   Like most literature, this guide uses ACF to denote the sample
    autocorrelation function as well as the autocorrelation function.
    What is denoted by ACF can easily be identified in context.

-   Clearly c0 is the sample variance of $\{X_t\}$. Besides,
    $r_0 = c_0/c_0 = 1$ and for any integer $k, |r_k| ≤ 1$.

-   When we compute the ACF of any sample series with a fixed length
    $n$, we cannot put too much confidence in the values of $r_k$ for
    large k’s, since fewer pairs of $(x_{t +k }, x_t )$ are available
    for calculating $r_k$ as $k$ is large. One rule of thumb is not to
    estimate $r_k$ for $k > n/3$, and another is $n ≥ 50, k ≤ n/4$. In
    any case, it is always a good idea to be careful.

-   We also compute the ACF of a nonstationary time series sample by
    Definition 1. In this case, however, the ACF or $r_k$ very slowly or
    hardly tapers off as $k$ increases.

-   Plotting the ACF $(r_k)$ against lag $k$ is easy but very helpful in
    analyzing time series sample. Such an ACF plot is known as a
    correlogram.

-   If $\{X_t\}$ is stationary with $E(X_t)=0$ and $\rho_k =0$ for all
    $k \neq 0$,thatis,itisa white noise series, then the sampling
    distribution of $r_k$ is asymptotically normal with the mean 0 and
    the variance of $1/n$. Hence, there is about 95% chance that $r_k$
    falls in the interval $[−1.96/\sqrt{n}, 1.96/\sqrt{n}]$.

Now we can give a summary that (1) if the time series plot of a time
series clearly shows a trend or/and seasonality, it is surely
nonstationary; (2) if the ACF $r_k$ very slowly or hardly tapers off as
lag $k$ increases, the time series should also be nonstationary.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[1],color="lime")
axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')

plt.show();
```

### Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* Multiplicative

### Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

### Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$

### Additive

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "additive", period=24)
a.plot();
```

![](/docs/models/HoltWinters_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-11-output-1.png)

### Multiplicative

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "Multiplicative", period=24)
a.plot();
```

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets

1.  Data to train our `Holt Winters Model`.
2.  Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 30 hours to test and evaluate the
performance of our model.

```python
train = df[df.ds<='2017-09-20 17:00:00'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2017-09-20 17:00:00']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((186, 3), (30, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.

```python
sns.lineplot(train,x="ds", y="y", label="Train", linestyle="--",linewidth=2)
sns.lineplot(test, x="ds", y="y", label="Test", linewidth=2, color="yellow")
plt.title("Ads watched (hourly data)");
plt.show()
```

## Implementation of Holt-Winters Method with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

To also know more about the parameters of the functions of the
`Holt-Winters Model`, they are listed below. For more information, visit
the
[documentation](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#holt-winters-method).

``` text
season_length : int
    Number of observations per unit of time. Ex: 12 Monthly data.
error_type : str
    The type of error of the ETS model. Can be additive (A) or multiplicative (M).
alias : str
    Custom name of the model.
prediction_intervals : Optional[ConformalIntervals]
    Information to compute conformal prediction intervals.
    By default, the model will compute the native prediction
    intervals.
```

### Load libraries

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import HoltWinters
```

### Instantiating Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful for `season_length`.

In this case we are going to test two alternatives of the model, one
additive and one multiplicative.

```python
season_length = 24 # Hourly data 
horizon = len(test) # number of predictions

models = [HoltWinters(season_length=season_length, error_type="A", alias="Add"),
          HoltWinters(season_length=season_length, error_type="M", alias="Multi")]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [panda’s
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.

```python
sf = StatsForecast(df=df,
                   models=models,
                   freq='H', 
                   n_jobs=-1)
```

### Fit the Model

```python
sf.fit()
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[Add,Multi])
```

Let’s see the results of our `Holt Winters Model`. We can observe it
with the following instruction:

```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
print(result.keys())
print(result['fit'])
```

Let us now visualize the fitted values of our models.

As we can see, the result obtained above has an output in a dictionary,
to extract each element from the dictionary we are going to use the
`.get()` function to extract the element and then we are going to save
it in a `pd.DataFrame()`.

```python
residual=pd.DataFrame(result.get("residuals"), columns=["residual Model"])
residual
```

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 30 hours ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 90% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min.

```python
Y_hat = sf.forecast(horizon, fitted=True)
Y_hat
```

With the forecast method we can also extract the fitted values from the
model and visualize it graphically, with the following instruction we
can do it.

```python

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 30 hours ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[95]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 95% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.

```python
sf.predict(h=horizon)
```

We can join the forecast result with the historical data using the
pandas function `pd.concat()`, and then be able to use this result for
graphing.

```python
pd.concat([df, forecast_df]).set_index('ds')

Now let’s visualize the result of our forecast and the historical data
of our time series, also let’s draw the confidence interval that we have
obtained when making the prediction with 95% confidence.

```python

    df_plot = pd.concat([y_hist, y_pred]).set_index('ds').tail(12*10)
    df_plot[['y'] + models].plot(ax=ax, linewidth=3 , )
    colors = ['black', "lime"]
    for model, color in zip(models, colors):
        ax.fill_between(df_plot.index,

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=)`, forecasting every second months
`(step_size=12)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 12 months ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.

```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=df,
                                         h=horizon,
                                         step_size=30,
                                         n_windows=3)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` index. If you dont like working with index just run
    `crossvalidation_df.resetindex()`.
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the `n_windows`.
-   `y:` true value
-   `model:` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.

```python
crossvalidation_df
```

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

We can now compute the accuracy of the forecast using an appropiate
accuracy metric. Here we’ll use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). To
do this, we first need to `install datasetsforecast`, a Python library
developed **by Nixtla** that includes a function to compute the RMSE.

```python
!pip install datasetsforecast
```

The function to compute the RMSE takes two arguments:

1.  The actual values.
2.  The forecasts, in this case, `Holt Winters Model`.

```python
from datasetsforecast.losses import mse, mae, rmse

def evaluate_cross_validation(df, metric):
    models = df.drop(columns=['ds', 'cutoff', 'y']).columns.tolist()
    evals = []
    for model in models:
        eval_ = df.groupby(['unique_id', 'cutoff']).apply(lambda x: metric(x['y'].values, x[model].values)).to_frame() # Calculate loss for every unique_id, model and cutoff.
        eval_.columns = [model]
        evals.append(eval_)
    evals = pd.concat(evals, axis=1)
    evals = evals.groupby(['unique_id']).mean(numeric_only=True) # Averages the error metrics for all cutoffs for every combination of model and unique_id
    evals['best_model'] = evals.idxmin(axis=1)
    return evals
```


```python
evaluation_df = evaluate_cross_validation(crossvalidation_df, rmse)

evaluation_df
```

|           | Add          | Multi        | best_model |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| unique_id |              |              |            |
| 1         | 12742.019531 | 13012.641602 | Add        |

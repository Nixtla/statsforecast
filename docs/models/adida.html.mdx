## Introduction <a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

The Aggregate-Disaggregate Intermittent Demand Approach (ADIDA) is a
forecasting method that is used to predict the demand for products that
exhibit intermittent demand patterns. Intermittent demand patterns are
characterized by a large number of zero observations, which can make
forecasting challenging.

The ADIDA method uses temporal aggregation to reduce the number of zero
observations and mitigate the effect of the variance observed in the
intervals. The method uses equally sized time buckets to perform
non-overlapping temporal aggregation and predict the demand over a
pre-specified lead time. The time bucket is set equal to the mean
inter-demand interval, which is the average time between two consecutive
non-zero observations.

The method uses the Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) technique to
obtain the forecasts. SES is a popular time series forecasting technique
that is commonly used for its simplicity and effectiveness in producing
accurate forecasts.

The ADIDA method has several advantages. It is easy to implement and can
be used for a wide range of intermittent demand patterns. The method
also provides accurate forecasts and can be used to predict the demand
over a pre-specified lead time.

However, the ADIDA method has some limitations. The method assumes that
the time buckets are equally sized, which may not be the case for all
intermittent demand patterns. Additionally, the method may not be
suitable for time series data with complex patterns or trends.

Overall, the ADIDA method is a useful forecasting technique for
intermittent demand patterns that can help mitigate the effect of zero
observations and produce accurate demand forecasts.

## ADIDA Model <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

### What is intermittent demand?

Intermittent demand is a demand pattern characterized by the irregular
and sporadic occurrence of events or sales. In other words, it refers to
situations in which the demand for a product or service occurs
intermittently, with periods of time in which there are no sales or
significant events.

Intermittent demand differs from constant or regular demand, where sales
occur in a predictable and consistent manner over time. In contrast, in
intermittent demand, periods without sales may be long and there may not
be a regular sequence of events.

This type of demand can occur in different industries and contexts, such
as low consumption products, seasonal products, high variability
products, products with short life cycles, or in situations where demand
depends on specific events or external factors.

Intermittent demand can pose challenges in forecasting and inventory
management, as it is difficult to predict when sales will occur and in
what quantity. Methods like the Croston model, which I mentioned
earlier, are used to address intermittent demand and generate more
accurate and appropriate forecasts for this type of demand pattern.

### Problem with intermittent demand

Intermittent demand can present various challenges and issues in
inventory management and demand forecasting. Some of the common problems
associated with intermittent demand are as follows:

1.  Unpredictable variability: Intermittent demand can have
    unpredictable variability, making planning and forecasting
    difficult. Demand patterns can be irregular and fluctuate
    dramatically between periods with sales and periods without sales.

2.  Low frequency of sales: Intermittent demand is characterized by long
    periods without sales. This can lead to inventory management
    difficulties, as it is necessary to hold enough stock to meet demand
    when it occurs, while avoiding excess inventory during non-sales
    periods.

3.  Forecast error: Forecasting intermittent demand can be more
    difficult to pin down than constant demand. Traditional forecast
    models may not be adequate to capture the variability and lack of
    patterns in intermittent demand, which can lead to significant
    errors in estimates of future demand.

4.  Impact on the supply chain: Intermittent demand can affect the
    efficiency of the supply chain and create difficulties in production
    planning, supplier management and logistics. Lead times and
    inventory levels must be adjusted to meet unpredictable demand.

5.  Operating costs: Managing inventory in situations of intermittent
    demand can increase operating costs. Maintaining adequate inventory
    during non-sales periods and managing stock levels may require
    additional investments in storage and logistics.

To address these issues, specific approaches to intermittent demand
management are used, such as specialized forecasting models, product
classification techniques, and tailored inventory strategies. These
solutions seek to minimize the impacts of variability and lack of
patterns in intermittent demand, optimizing inventory management and
improving supply chain efficiency.

### ADIDA Model

The ADIDA model is based on the Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
method and uses temporal aggregation to handle the problem of
intermittent demand. The mathematical development of the model can be
summarized as follows:

Let St be the demand at time $t$, where $t = 1, 2, ..., T$. The mean
inter-demand interval is denoted as MI, which is the average time
between two consecutive non-zero demands. The time bucket size is set
equal to MI.

The demand data is then aggregated into non-overlapping time buckets of
size MI. Let Bt be the demand in bucket $t$, where
$t = 1, 2, ..., T/MI$. The aggregated demand data can be represented as:

$$B_t = \sum S_t, for (t-1)*MI + 1 ≤ j ≤ t*MI$$

The SES method is then applied to the aggregated demand data to obtain
the forecasts. The forecast for bucket $t$ is denoted as $F_t$. The SES
method involves estimating the level $L_t$ at time t based on the actual
demand $D_t$ at time t and the estimated level at the previous time
period, $L_{t-1}$, using the following equation:

$$L_t = \alpha * D_t + (1 - α) * L_{t-1}$$

where $\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter that controls the weight given
to the current demand value.

The forecast for bucket $t$ is then obtained by using the estimated
level at the previous time period, $L_{t-1}$, as follows:

$$F_t = L_{t-1}$$

The forecasts are then disaggregated to obtain the demand predictions
for the original time period. Let $Y_t$ be the demand prediction at time
$t$. The disaggregation can be performed using the following equation:

$$Y_t = F_t / MI, for (t-1)*MI + 1 ≤ j ≤ t*MI$$

### How can you determine if the ADIDA model is suitable for a specific data set?

To determine if the ADIDA model is suitable for a specific data set, the
following steps can be followed:

1.  Analyze the demand pattern: Examine the demand pattern of the data
    to determine if it fits an intermittent pattern. Intermittent data
    is characterized by a high proportion of zeros and sporadic demands
    in specific periods.

2.  Evaluate seasonality: Check if there is a clear seasonality in the
    data. The ADIDA model assumes that there is no seasonality or that
    it can be handled by temporal aggregation. If the data show complex
    seasonality or cannot be handled by temporal aggregation, the ADIDA
    model may not be suitable.

3.  Data requirements: Consider the data requirements of the ADIDA
    model. The model requires historical demand data and the ability to
    calculate the mean interval between non-zero demands. Make sure you
    have enough data to estimate the parameters and that the data is
    available at a frequency suitable for temporal aggregation.

4.  Performance evaluation: Perform a performance evaluation of the
    ADIDA model on the specific data set. Compare model-generated
    forecasts with actual demand values and use evaluation metrics such
    as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean square error (MSE). If the
    model performs well and produces accurate forecasts on the data set,
    this is an indication that it is suitable for that data set.

5.  Comparison with other models: Compare the performance of the ADIDA
    model with other forecast models suitable for intermittent data.
    Consider models like Croston, Syntetos-Boylan Approximation (SBA),
    or models based on exponential smoothing techniques that have been
    developed specifically for intermittent data. If the ADIDA model
    shows similar or better performance than other models, it can be
    considered suitable.

Remember that the adequacy of the ADIDA model may depend on the specific
nature of the data and the context of the forecasting problem. It is
advisable to carry out a thorough analysis and experiment with different
models to determine the most appropriate approach for the data set in
question.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naren8520/Serie-de-tiempo-con-Machine-Learning/main/Data/tipos_malarias_choco_colombia.csv", sep=";", usecols=[0,4])
df = df.dropna()
df.head()
```

|     | semanas    | malaria_falciparum |
|-----|------------|--------------------|
| 0   | 2007-12-31 | 50.0               |
| 1   | 2008-01-07 | 62.0               |

| 4   | 2008-01-28 | 38.0               |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.


```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds         | y    | unique_id |
|-----|------------|------|-----------|
| 0   | 2007-12-31 | 50.0 | 1         |

| 4   | 2008-01-28 | 38.0 | 1         |


```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds            object
y            float64
unique_id     object
dtype: object
```

We need to convert the `object` types to datetime and numeric.


```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
df["y"] = df["y"].astype(float).astype("int64")
```

## Explore data with the plot method <a class="anchor" id="plotting"></a>

Plot a series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class. This
method prints a random series from the dataset and is useful for basic
EDA.


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

### Autocorrelation plots


```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[1],color="lime")
axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')

plt.show();
```

### Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* Multiplicative

### Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = Level + Trend + Seasonality + Noise$$

### Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$


```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def plot_seasonal_decompose(
    x,
    model='additive',
    filt=None,
    period=None,
    two_sided=True,
    extrapolate_trend=0,
    title="Seasonal Decomposition"):

    result = seasonal_decompose(
            x, model=model, filt=filt, period=period,
            two_sided=two_sided, extrapolate_trend=extrapolate_trend)
    fig = make_subplots(
            rows=4, cols=1,
            subplot_titles=["Observed", "Trend", "Seasonal", "Residuals"])
    for idx, col in enumerate(['observed', 'trend', 'seasonal', 'resid']):
        fig.add_trace(
            go.Scatter(x=result.observed.index, y=getattr(result, col), mode='lines'),
                row=idx+1, col=1,
            )
    return fig
```


```python
plot_seasonal_decompose(
    df["y"],
    model="additive",
    period=52,
    title="Seasonal Decomposition")
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/ADIDA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-10-output-2.png)

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets 1. Data to train our `ADIDA Model`. 2.
Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 25 week to test and evaluate the
performance of our model.


```python
train = df[df.ds<='2022-07-04'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2022-07-04']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((758, 3), (25, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.


```python
sns.lineplot(train,x="ds", y="y", label="Train", linestyle="--",linewidth=2)
sns.lineplot(test, x="ds", y="y", label="Test", linewidth=2, color="yellow")
plt.title("Falciparum Malaria");
plt.show()
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/ADIDA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-13-output-1.png)

## Implementation of `ADIDA Model` with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

To also know more about the parameters of the functions of the
`ADIDA Model`, they are listed below. For more information, visit the
[documentation](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#adida).

``` text
alias : str
    Custom name of the model.
prediction_intervals : Optional[ConformalIntervals]
    Information to compute conformal prediction intervals.
    By default, the model will compute the native prediction
    intervals.
```

### Load libraries


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import ADIDA
```

### Instantiating Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful for `season_length`.


```python
season_length = 52 # Hourly data 
horizon = len(test) # number of predictions

# We call the model that we are going to use
models = [ADIDA()]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
object with the following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.


```python
sf = StatsForecast(models=models,
                   freq='7d', 
                   n_jobs=-1)
```

### Fit the Model

Here, we call the `fit()` method to fit the model.


```python
sf.fit(df=train)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[ADIDA])
```

Let’s see the results of our `ADIDA Model`. We can observe it with the
following instruction:


```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
result
```

``` text
{'mean': array([336.74736919])}
```

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `forecast()` method does not store the
fitted values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 25 week ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min.


```python
Y_hat = sf.forecast(df=train, h=horizon)
Y_hat
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | ADIDA      |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2022-07-11 | 336.747375 |
| 1   | 1         | 2022-07-18 | 336.747375 |
| 2   | 1         | 2022-07-25 | 336.747375 |
| ... | ...       | ...        | ...        |
| 22  | 1         | 2022-12-12 | 336.747375 |
| 23  | 1         | 2022-12-19 | 336.747375 |
| 24  | 1         | 2022-12-26 | 336.747375 |


```python
sf.plot(train, Y_hat.merge(test))
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/ADIDA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-20-output-1.png)

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 25 week ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.


```python
forecast_df = sf.predict(h=horizon) 
forecast_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | ADIDA      |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2022-07-11 | 336.747375 |
| 1   | 1         | 2022-07-18 | 336.747375 |
| 2   | 1         | 2022-07-25 | 336.747375 |
| 3   | 1         | 2022-08-01 | 336.747375 |
| 4   | 1         | 2022-08-08 | 336.747375 |

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

<figure>

alt="img" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">img</figcaption>
</figure>

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=)`, forecasting every second months
`(step_size=12)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 12 months ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.


```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=df,
                                         h=horizon,
                                         step_size=30,
                                         n_windows=5)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` series identifier
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the `n_windows`.
-   `y:` true value
-   `model:` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.


```python
crossvalidation_df
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | cutoff     | y     | ADIDA      |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|-------|------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2020-03-23 | 2020-03-16 | 317.0 | 251.901505 |

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

Now we are going to evaluate our model with the results of the
predictions, we will use different types of metrics MAE, MAPE, MASE,
RMSE, SMAPE to evaluate the accuracy.


```python
from functools import partial

import utilsforecast.losses as ufl
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
evaluate(
    test.merge(Y_hat),
    metrics=[ufl.mae, ufl.mape, partial(ufl.mase, seasonality=season_length), ufl.rmse, ufl.smape],
    train_df=train,
)
```

|     | unique_id | metric | ADIDA      |
|-----|-----------|--------|------------|
| 0   | 1         | mae    | 114.527585 |
| 1   | 1         | mape   | 0.820029   |
| 2   | 1         | mase   | 0.874115   |
| 3   | 1         | rmse   | 129.749320 |
| 4   | 1         | smape  | 0.221878   |

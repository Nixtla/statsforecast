## What is AutoArima with StatsForecast? <a class="anchor" id="#introduction"></a>

An autoARIMA is a time series model that uses an automatic process to
select the optimal ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
model parameters for a given time series. ARIMA is a widely used
statistical model for modeling and predicting time series.

The process of automatic parameter selection in an autoARIMA model is
performed using statistical and optimization techniques, such as the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and cross-validation, to identify
optimal values for autoregression, integration, and moving average
parameters. of the ARIMA model.

Automatic parameter selection is useful because it can be difficult to
determine the optimal parameters of an ARIMA model for a given time
series without a thorough understanding of the underlying stochastic
process that generates the time series. The autoARIMA model automates
the parameter selection process and can provide a fast and effective
solution for time series modeling and forecasting.

The `statsforecast.models` library brings the
[`AutoARIMA`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoarima)
function from Python provides an implementation of autoARIMA that allows
to automatically select the optimal parameters for an ARIMA model given
a time series.

## Definition of the Arima model <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

An Arima model (autoregressive integrated moving average) process is the
combination of an autoregressive process AR(p), integration I(d), and
the moving average process MA(q).

Just like the ARMA process, the ARIMA process states that the present
value is dependent on past values, coming from the AR(p) portion, and
past errors, coming from the MA(q) portion. However, instead of using
the original series, denoted as yt, the ARIMA process uses the
differenced series, denoted as $y'_{t}$. Note that $y'_{t}$ can
represent a series that has been differenced more than once.

Therefore, the mathematical expression of the ARIMA(p,d,q) process
states that the present value of the differenced series $y'_{t}$ is
equal to the sum of a constant $C$, past values of the differenced
series $\phi_{p}y'_{t-p}$, the mean of the differenced series $\mu$,
past error terms $\theta_{q}\varepsilon_{t-q}$, and a current error term
$\varepsilon_{t}$, as shown in equation

where $y'_{t}$ is the differenced series (it may have been differenced
more than once). The “predictors” on the right hand side include both
lagged values of $y_{t}$ and lagged errors. We call this an **ARIMA(
p,d,q)** model, where

|     |                                       |
|-----|---------------------------------------|
| p   | order of the autoregressive part      |
| d   | degree of first differencing involved |
| q   | order of the moving average part      |

The same stationarity and invertibility conditions that are used for
autoregressive and moving average models also apply to an ARIMA model.

Many of the models we have already discussed are special cases of the
ARIMA model, as shown in Table

| Model | p d q | Differenced | Method |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Arima(0,0,0) | 0 0 0 | $y_t=Y_t$ | White noise |
| ARIMA (0,1,0) | 0 1 0 | $y_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}$ | Random walk |
| ARIMA (0,2,0) | 0 2 0 | $y_t = Y_t - 2Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2}$ | Constant |
| ARIMA (1,0,0) | 1 0 0 | $\hat Y_t = \mu + \Phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \epsilon$ | AR(1): AR(1): First-order regression model |
| ARIMA (2, 0, 0) | 2 0 0 | $\hat Y_t = \Phi_0 + \Phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \Phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \epsilon$ | AR(2): Second-order regression model |
| ARIMA (1, 1, 0) | 1 1 0 | $\hat Y_t = \mu + Y_{t-1} + \Phi_1 (Y_{t-1}- Y_{t-2})$ | Differenced first-order autoregressive model |
| ARIMA (0, 1, 1) | 0 1 1 | $\hat Y_t = Y_{t-1} - \Phi_1 e^{t-1}$ | Simple exponential smoothing |
| ARIMA (0, 0, 1) | 0 0 1 | $\hat Y_t = \mu_0+ \epsilon_t - \omega_1 \epsilon_{t-1}$ | MA(1): First-order regression model |
| ARIMA (0, 0, 2) | 0 0 2 | $\hat Y_t = \mu_0+ \epsilon_t - \omega_1 \epsilon_{t-1} - \omega_2 \epsilon_{t-2}$ | MA(2): Second-order regression model |
| ARIMA (1, 0, 1) | 1 0 1 | $\hat Y_t = \Phi_0 + \Phi_1 Y_{t-1}+ \epsilon_t - \omega_1 \epsilon_{t-1}$ | ARMA model |
| ARIMA (1, 1, 1) | 1 1 1 | $\Delta Y_t = \Phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t - \omega_1 \epsilon_{t-1}$ | ARIMA model |
| ARIMA (1, 1, 2) | 1 1 2 | $\hat Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \Phi_1 (Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2} )- \Theta_1 e_{t-1} - \Theta_1 e_{t-1}$ | Damped-trend linear Exponential smoothing |
| ARIMA (0, 2, 1) OR (0,2,2) | 0 2 1 | $\hat Y_t = 2 Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2} - \Theta_1 e_{t-1} - \Theta_2 e_{t-2}$ | Linear exponential smoothing |

Once we start combining components in this way to form more complicated
models, it is much easier to work with the backshift notation. For
example, Equation (1) can be written in backshift notation as:

Selecting appropriate values for p, d and q can be difficult. However,
the `AutoARIMA()` function from `statsforecast` will do it for you
automatically.

## Loading libraries and data <a class="anchor" id="loading"></a>

Using an `AutoARIMA()` model to model and predict time series has
several advantages, including:

1.  Automation of the parameter selection process: The `AutoARIMA()`
    function automates the ARIMA model parameter selection process,
    which can save the user time and effort by eliminating the need to
    manually try different combinations of parameters.

2.  Reduction of prediction error: By automatically selecting optimal
    parameters, the **ARIMA** model can improve the accuracy of
    predictions compared to manually selected **ARIMA** models.

3.  Identification of complex patterns: The `AutoARIMA()` function can
    identify complex patterns in the data that may be difficult to
    detect visually or with other time series modeling techniques.

4.  Flexibility in the choice of the parameter selection methodology:
    The **ARIMA** Model can use different methodologies to select the
    optimal parameters, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
    cross-validation and others, which allows the user to choose the
    methodology that best suits their needs.

In general, using the `AutoARIMA()` function can help improve the
efficiency and accuracy of time series modeling and forecasting,
especially for users who are inexperienced with manual parameter
selection for ARIMA models.

### Main results

We compared accuracy and speed against
[pmdarima](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima), Rob Hyndman’s
[forecast](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast) package and
Facebook’s [Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet). We used the
`Daily`, `Hourly` and `Weekly` data from the [M4
competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301128).

The following table summarizes the results. As can be seen, our
`auto_arima` is the best model in accuracy (measured by the `MASE` loss)
and time, even compared with the original implementation in R.

| dataset | metric | auto_arima_nixtla | auto_arima_pmdarima \[1\] | auto_arima_r | prophet |
|:--------|:--------|---------------:|-----------------:|------------:|--------:|
| Daily | MASE | **3.26** | 3.35 | 4.46 | 14.26 |
| Daily | time | **1.41** | 27.61 | 1.81 | 514.33 |
| Hourly | MASE | **0.92** | — | 1.02 | 1.78 |
| Hourly | time | **12.92** | — | 23.95 | 17.27 |
| Weekly | MASE | **2.34** | 2.47 | 2.58 | 7.29 |
| Weekly | time | 0.42 | 2.92 | **0.22** | 19.82 |

\[1\] The model `auto_arima` from `pmdarima` had a problem with Hourly
data. An issue was opened.

The following table summarizes the data details.

| group  | n_series | mean_length | std_length | min_length | max_length |
|:-------|---------:|------------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| Daily  |    4,227 |       2,371 |      1,756 |        107 |      9,933 |
| Hourly |      414 |         901 |        127 |        748 |      1,008 |

Next, we import plotting libraries and configure the plotting style.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

import scipy.stats as stats
```


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_pacf
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5
dark_style = {

    'axes.facecolor': '#212946',
    'savefig.facecolor':'#212946',
    'axes.grid': True,
    'axes.grid.which': 'both',
    'axes.spines.left': False,

plt.rcParams.update(dark_style)

from pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18,7)
```

### Loading Data

```python
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naren8520/Serie-de-tiempo-con-Machine-Learning/main/Data/candy_production.csv")
df.head()
```

|     | observation_date | IPG3113N |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| 0   | 1972-01-01       | 85.6945  |
| 1   | 1972-02-01       | 71.8200  |
| 2   | 1972-03-01       | 66.0229  |
| 3   | 1972-04-01       | 64.5645  |
| 4   | 1972-05-01       | 65.0100  |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds         | y       | unique_id |
|-----|------------|---------|-----------|
| 0   | 1972-01-01 | 85.6945 | 1         |
| 1   | 1972-02-01 | 71.8200 | 1         |
| 2   | 1972-03-01 | 66.0229 | 1         |
| 3   | 1972-04-01 | 64.5645 | 1         |
| 4   | 1972-05-01 | 65.0100 | 1         |

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds            object
y            float64
unique_id     object
dtype: object
```

We need to convert `ds` from the `object` type to datetime.

```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

## Explore data with the plot method <a class="anchor" id="plotting"></a>

Plot a series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class. This
method prints a random series from the dataset and is useful for basic
EDA.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

### Autocorrelation plots

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=60, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=60, ax=axs[1],color="lime")
axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')

plt.show();
```

### Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* multiplicative

Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

## Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "add", period=12)
a.plot();
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/AutoARIMA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-10-output-1.png)

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets 1. Data to train our `AutoArima` model
2. Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 12 months to test and evaluate
the performance of our model.

```python
Y_train_df = df[df.ds<='2016-08-01'] 
Y_test_df = df[df.ds>'2016-08-01']
```


```python
Y_train_df.shape, Y_test_df.shape
```

``` text
((536, 3), (12, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.

```python
sns.lineplot(Y_train_df,x="ds", y="y", label="Train")
sns.lineplot(Y_test_df, x="ds", y="y", label="Test")
plt.show()
```

# Implementation of AutoArima with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

### Load libraries

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA
from statsforecast.arima import arima_string
```

### Instantiating Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/)) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful.season_length

```python
season_length = 12 # Monthly data 
horizon = len(Y_test_df) # number of predictions

models = [AutoARIMA(season_length=season_length)]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See panda’s
    available frequencies.)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.

```python
sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='MS')
```

### Fit the Model

```python
sf.fit(df=Y_train_df)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[AutoARIMA])
```

Once we have entered our model, we can use the
[`arima_string`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/arima.html#arima_string)
function to see the parameters that the model has found.

```python
arima_string(sf.fitted_[0,0].model_)
```

``` text
'ARIMA(4,0,3)(0,1,1)[12]                   '
```

The automation process gave us that the best model found is a model of
the form `ARIMA(4,0,3)(0,1,1)[12]`, this means that our model contains
$p=4$ , that is, it has a non-seasonal autogressive element, on the
other hand, our model contains a seasonal part, which has an order of
$D=1$, that is, it has a seasonal differential, and $q=3$ that contains
3 moving average element.

To know the values of the terms of our model, we can use the following
statement to know all the result of the model made.

```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
print(result.keys())
print(result['arma'])
```

``` text
dict_keys(['coef', 'sigma2', 'var_coef', 'mask', 'loglik', 'aic', 'arma', 'residuals', 'code', 'n_cond', 'nobs', 'model', 'bic', 'aicc', 'ic', 'xreg', 'x', 'lambda'])
(4, 3, 0, 1, 12, 0, 1)
```

Let us now visualize the residuals of our models.

As we can see, the result obtained above has an output in a dictionary,
to extract each element from the dictionary we are going to use the
`.get()` function to extract the element and then we are going to save
it in a `pd.DataFrame()`.

```python
residual=pd.DataFrame(result.get("residuals"), columns=["residual Model"])
residual
```

|     | residual Model |
|-----|----------------|
| 0   | 0.085694       |
| 1   | 0.071820       |
| 2   | 0.066022       |
| ... | ...            |
| 533 | 1.615486       |
| 534 | -0.394285      |
| 535 | -6.733548      |

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2)

# plot[1,1]
residual.plot(ax=axs[0,0])
axs[0,0].set_title("Residuals");

# plot
sns.distplot(residual, ax=axs[0,1]);
axs[0,1].set_title("Density plot - Residual");

# plot
stats.probplot(residual["residual Model"], dist="norm", plot=axs[1,0])
axs[1,0].set_title('Plot Q-Q')

# plot
plot_acf(residual,  lags=35, ax=axs[1,1],color="fuchsia")
axs[1,1].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plt.show();
```

To generate forecasts we only have to use the predict method specifying
the forecast horizon (h). In addition, to calculate prediction intervals
associated to the forecasts, we can include the parameter level that
receives a list of levels of the prediction intervals we want to build.
In this case we will only calculate the 90% forecast interval
(level=\[90\]).

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 90% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min. (If you want to speed things up to a couple of seconds,
remove the AutoModels like
[`ARIMA`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#arima)
and
[`Theta`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#theta))

```python
Y_hat_df = sf.forecast(df=Y_train_df, h=horizon, fitted=True)
Y_hat_df.head()
```

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[95]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 95% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.

```python
sf.predict(h=12)
```

We can join the forecast result with the historical data using the
pandas function `pd.concat()`, and then be able to use this result for
graphing.

```python
df_plot=pd.concat([df, forecast_df]).set_index('ds').tail(220)
df_plot
```

Now let’s visualize the result of our forecast and the historical data
of our time series, also let’s draw the confidence interval that we have
obtained when making the prediction with 95% confidence.

```python
sf.plot(df, forecast_df, level=[95], max_insample_length=12 * 5)
```

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=5)`, forecasting every second months
`(step_size=12)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 12 months ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.

```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=Y_train_df,
                                         h=12,
                                         step_size=12,
                                         n_windows=5)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` series identifier
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the n_windows.
-   `y:` true value
-   `"model":` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.

```python
crossvalidation_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | cutoff     | y        | AutoARIMA  |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2011-09-01 | 2011-08-01 | 93.9062  | 105.235606 |
| 1   | 1         | 2011-10-01 | 2011-08-01 | 116.7634 | 118.739813 |
| 2   | 1         | 2011-11-01 | 2011-08-01 | 116.8258 | 114.572924 |
| 3   | 1         | 2011-12-01 | 2011-08-01 | 114.9563 | 114.991219 |
| 4   | 1         | 2012-01-01 | 2011-08-01 | 99.9662  | 100.133142 |

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

Now we are going to evaluate our model with the results of the
predictions, we will use different types of metrics MAE, MAPE, MASE,
RMSE, SMAPE to evaluate the accuracy.

```python
from functools import partial

import utilsforecast.losses as ufl
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
evaluate(
    Y_test_df.merge(Y_hat_df),
    metrics=[ufl.mae, ufl.mape, partial(ufl.mase, seasonality=season_length), ufl.rmse, ufl.smape],
    train_df=Y_train_df,
)
```

|     | unique_id | metric | AutoARIMA |
|-----|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 0   | 1         | mae    | 5.012894  |
| 1   | 1         | mape   | 0.045046  |
| 2   | 1         | mase   | 0.967601  |
| 3   | 1         | rmse   | 5.680362  |
| 4   | 1         | smape  | 0.022673  |

## Introduction <a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

The Croston model is a method used in time series analysis to forecast
demand in situations where there are intermittent data or frequent
zeros. It was developed by J.D. Croston in 1972 and is especially useful
in industries such as inventory management, retail sales, and demand
forecasting for products with low sales frequency.

The Croston model is based on two main components:

1.  Intermittent Demand Rate: Calculates the demand rate for periods in
    which sales or events occur, ignoring periods without sales. This
    rate is used to estimate the probability that a claim will occur in
    the future.

2.  Demand Interval: Calculates the time interval between sales or
    events occurring, again ignoring non-sales periods. This interval is
    used to estimate the probability that a demand will occur in the
    next period.

The Croston model combines these two estimates to generate a weighted
forecast that takes into account both the rate of intermittent demand
and the interval between demands. This approach helps address the
challenge of forecasting demand in situations where the time series has
many zeros or missing values.

It is important to note that the Croston model is a simplification and
does not account for other possible sources of variability or patterns
in the demand data. Therefore, its accuracy may be affected in
situations where there are external factors or changes in demand
behavior.

## Croston Classic Model <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

### What is intermittent demand?

Intermittent demand is a demand pattern characterized by the irregular
and sporadic occurrence of events or sales. In other words, it refers to
situations in which the demand for a product or service occurs
intermittently, with periods of time in which there are no sales or
significant events.

Intermittent demand differs from constant or regular demand, where sales
occur in a predictable and consistent manner over time. In contrast, in
intermittent demand, periods without sales may be long and there may not
be a regular sequence of events.

This type of demand can occur in different industries and contexts, such
as low consumption products, seasonal products, high variability
products, products with short life cycles, or in situations where demand
depends on specific events or external factors.

Intermittent demand can pose challenges in forecasting and inventory
management, as it is difficult to predict when sales will occur and in
what quantity. Methods like the Croston model, which I mentioned
earlier, are used to address intermittent demand and generate more
accurate and appropriate forecasts for this type of demand pattern.

### Problem with intermittent demand

Intermittent demand can present various challenges and issues in
inventory management and demand forecasting. Some of the common problems
associated with intermittent demand are as follows:

1.  Unpredictable variability: Intermittent demand can have
    unpredictable variability, making planning and forecasting
    difficult. Demand patterns can be irregular and fluctuate
    dramatically between periods with sales and periods without sales.

2.  Low frequency of sales: Intermittent demand is characterized by long
    periods without sales. This can lead to inventory management
    difficulties, as it is necessary to hold enough stock to meet demand
    when it occurs, while avoiding excess inventory during non-sales
    periods.

3.  Forecast error: Forecasting intermittent demand can be more
    difficult to pin down than constant demand. Traditional forecast
    models may not be adequate to capture the variability and lack of
    patterns in intermittent demand, which can lead to significant
    errors in estimates of future demand.

4.  Impact on the supply chain: Intermittent demand can affect the
    efficiency of the supply chain and create difficulties in production
    planning, supplier management and logistics. Lead times and
    inventory levels must be adjusted to meet unpredictable demand.

5.  Operating costs: Managing inventory in situations of intermittent
    demand can increase operating costs. Maintaining adequate inventory
    during non-sales periods and managing stock levels may require
    additional investments in storage and logistics.

To address these issues, specific approaches to intermittent demand
management are used, such as specialized forecasting models, product
classification techniques, and tailored inventory strategies. These
solutions seek to minimize the impacts of variability and lack of
patterns in intermittent demand, optimizing inventory management and
improving supply chain efficiency.

### Croston’s method(CR)

Croston’s method(CR) is a classic method that specifically dealing with
intermittent demand, it was developed base upon the Simple Exponential
Smoothing method. When Croston dealing with the intermittent demand, he
found out that by using the SES, the level of forecasting in each
period’s demand are normally higher than it’s actual value, which lead
to a very low accuracy. After a period of times of research, he came out
a method that optimize the result of the intermittent demand
forecasting.

This method basically decompose the intermittent demand into two parts:
the size of non-zero demand and the time interval of those demand
occurred, and then apply the simple exponential smoothing on both part.
Where the formula is follow:

if $Z_t=0$ then:

$$Z'_t= Z'_{t-1}$$

$$P'_t= P'_{t-1}$$

Otherwise

$$Z'_t=\alpha Z_t +(1-\alpha) Z'_{t-1}$$

$$P'_t=\alpha P_t +(1-\alpha) P'_{t-1}$$

where $0< \alpha < 1$

And finally by combining these forecasts

$${Y'}_t = \frac{{Z'}_t}{{P'}_t}$$

Where

-   ${Y'}_t:$ Average demand per period.
-   $Z_t:$ Actual demand at period $t$.
-   $Z'_t:$ Time between two positive demand.
-   $P:$ Demand size forecast for next period.
-   $P_t:$ Forecast of demand interval.
-   $\alpha :$ Smoothing constant.

Croston’s method converse the intermittent demand time series into a
non-zero demand time series and a demand interval time series, many
cases show that this method work quite well, but before apply Croston’s
method, three assumptions should be made:

-   The non-zero demand are independent and obey normal distribution;
-   The demand intervals are independent and obey geometric
    distribution;
-   There are mutual independence between the demand size and demand
    intervals.

According to many real cases show that, Croston’s method is suitable for
the situation which the lead time obey normal distribution, for those
demand series which contain large amount of zero values, Croston’s
method did not shows a outstanding performance, sometimes even worse
than SES method.

Additionally, Croston’s method can only provide the average demand for
each period, it can not give a forecast of the demand size for each
period, it can not forecast which period will occurred a demand, and it
also can not come out a probability of whether a period will occurred a
demand.

After all, although Croston’s method is a very classic and wide use
method, it still has a lots of limitations, but after years of research
carried by statisticians and scholars, few variations of Croston’s
method were brought up.

### Croston’s variations

Croston’s method is the main model used in demand forecasting area, most
of the works are based upon this model. However, in 2001 Syntetos and
Boylan proposed that Croston’s method is no a unbiased method, while
some empirical evidence also showed that the losses in performance which
use the Croston’s method (Sani and Kingsman, 1997). Plenty of further
research is done in improving the Croston’s method. Syntetos and Boylan
(2005) proposed an approximate unbiased procedure that provide less
variance in the result of estimate, which is known as SBA (Syntetos and
Boylan Approximate). Recently, Teunter et al. (2011) also proposed a
intermittent forecasting method that can deal with obsolescence, which
is based on Croston’s method known as TSB method (Teunter, Syntetos and
Babai).

### Area of application of the Croston method

The Croston method is commonly applied in the field of inventory
management and demand forecasting in situations of intermittent demand.
Some specific areas where the Croston model can be applied are:

1.  Inventory management: The Croston model is used to forecast demand
    for products with sporadic or intermittent sales. Helps determine
    optimal inventory levels and replenishment policies, minimizing
    inventory costs and ensuring adequate availability to meet
    intermittent demand.

2.  Retail sales: In the retail sector, especially in products with low
    sales frequency or irregular sales, the Croston model can be useful
    for forecasting demand and optimizing inventory planning in stores
    or warehouses.

3.  Demand forecasting: In general, the Croston model is applied in
    demand forecasting when there is a lack of clear patterns or high
    variability in the time series. It can be used in various
    industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry, the automotive
    industry, the perishable goods industry, and other sectors where
    intermittent demand is common.

4.  Supply Chain Planning: The Croston model can be used in supply chain
    planning and management to improve the accuracy of intermittent
    demand forecasts. This helps streamline production, inventory
    management, supplier order scheduling, and other aspects of the
    supply chain.

It is important to note that Croston’s model is just one of many
approaches available to address intermittent demand. Depending on the
context and the specific characteristics of the time series, there may
be other more appropriate methods and techniques.

### Croston Method for Stationary Time Series

No, the time series in the Croston method does not have to be
stationary. The Croston method is an effective forecasting method for
intermittent time series, even if they are not stationary. However, if
the time series is stationary, the Croston method may be more accurate.

The Croston method is based on the idea that intermittent time series
can be decomposed into two components: a demand component and a time
between demands component. The demand component is forecast using a
standard time series forecasting method, such as single or double
exponential smoothing. The time component between demands is forecast
using a probability distribution function, such as a Poisson
distribution or a Weibull distribution.

The Croston method then combines the forecasts for the two components to
obtain a total demand forecast for the next period.

If the time series is stationary, the two components of the time series
will be stationary as well. This means that the Croston method will be
able to forecast the two components more accurately.

However, even if the time series is not stationary, the Croston method
can still be an effective forecasting method. The Croston method is a
robust method that can handle time series with irregular demand
patterns.

If you are using the Croston method to forecast an intermittent time
series that is not stationary, it is important to choose a standard time
series forecast method that is effective for nonstationary time series.
Double exponential smoothing is an effective forecasting method for
non-stationary time series.

Next, we import plotting libraries and configure the plotting style.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
plt.style.use('grayscale') # fivethirtyeight  grayscale  classic
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5

    'axes.spines.left': False,
    'axes.spines.right': False,
    'axes.spines.top': False,
    'axes.spines.bottom': False,

plt.rcParams.update(dark_style)


from pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18,7)
```


```python
import pandas as pd

df=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naren8520/Serie-de-tiempo-con-Machine-Learning/main/Data/intermittend_demand2")
df.head()
```

|     | date                | sales |
|-----|---------------------|-------|
| 0   | 2022-01-01 00:00:00 | 0     |
| 1   | 2022-01-01 01:00:00 | 10    |
| 2   | 2022-01-01 02:00:00 | 0     |
| 3   | 2022-01-01 03:00:00 | 0     |
| 4   | 2022-01-01 04:00:00 | 100   |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.


```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds                  | y   | unique_id |
|-----|---------------------|-----|-----------|
| 0   | 2022-01-01 00:00:00 | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 2022-01-01 01:00:00 | 10  | 1         |
| 2   | 2022-01-01 02:00:00 | 0   | 1         |
| 3   | 2022-01-01 03:00:00 | 0   | 1         |
| 4   | 2022-01-01 04:00:00 | 100 | 1         |


```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds           object
y             int64
unique_id    object
dtype: object
```

We can see that our time variable `(ds)` is in an object format, we need
to convert to a date format


```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

## Explore Data with the plot method <a class="anchor" id="plotting"></a>

Plot some series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class.
This method prints a random series from the dataset and is useful for
basic EDA.


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

### Autocorrelation plots


```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[1],color="lime")
axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')

plt.show();
```

### Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* Multiplicative

### Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

### Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$


```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def plotSeasonalDecompose(
    x,
    model='additive',
    filt=None,
    period=None,
    two_sided=True,
    extrapolate_trend=0,
    title="Seasonal Decomposition"):

    result = seasonal_decompose(
            x, model=model, filt=filt, period=period,
            two_sided=two_sided, extrapolate_trend=extrapolate_trend)
    fig = make_subplots(
            rows=4, cols=1,
            subplot_titles=["Observed", "Trend", "Seasonal", "Residuals"])
    for idx, col in enumerate(['observed', 'trend', 'seasonal', 'resid']):
        fig.add_trace(
            go.Scatter(x=result.observed.index, y=getattr(result, col), mode='lines'),
                row=idx+1, col=1,
            )
    return fig
```


```python
plotSeasonalDecompose(
    df["y"],
    model="additive",
    period=24,
    title="Seasonal Decomposition")
```

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets

1.  Data to train our `Croston Classic Model`.
2.  Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 500 hours to test and evaluate
the performance of our model.


```python
train = df[df.ds<='2023-01-31 19:00:00'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2023-01-31 19:00:00']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((9500, 3), (500, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.


```python
sns.lineplot(train,x="ds", y="y", label="Train", linestyle="--",linewidth=2)
sns.lineplot(test, x="ds", y="y", label="Test", linewidth=2, color="yellow")
plt.title("Store visit");
plt.show()
```

## Implementation of CrostonClassic with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

To also know more about the parameters of the functions of the
`CrostonClassic Model`, they are listed below. For more information,
visit the
[documentation](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#crostonclassic).

``` text
alias : str
    Custom name of the model.
```

### Load libraries


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import CrostonClassic
```

### Instantiating Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful for `season_length`.


```python
season_length = 24 # Hourly data 
horizon = len(test) # number of predictions

models = [CrostonClassic()]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.


```python
sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='h')
```

### Fit the Model


```python
sf.fit(df=train)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[CrostonClassic])
```

Let’s see the results of our `Croston Classic Model`. We can observe it
with the following instruction:


```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
result
```

``` text
{'mean': array([27.41841685]),
 'fitted': array([     nan,  0.     ,  5.     , ..., 30.61961, 30.61961, 30.61961],
       dtype=float32),
 'sigma': np.float32(49.5709)}
```

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 25 week ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min.


```python
Y_hat = sf.forecast(df=train, h=horizon)
Y_hat
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | CrostonClassic |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2023-01-31 20:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 1   | 1         | 2023-01-31 21:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 2   | 1         | 2023-01-31 22:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| ... | ...       | ...                 | ...            |
| 497 | 1         | 2023-02-21 13:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 498 | 1         | 2023-02-21 14:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 499 | 1         | 2023-02-21 15:00:00 | 27.418417      |


```python
sf.plot(train, Y_hat, max_insample_length=500)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/CrostonClassic_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-20-output-1.png)

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 500 hours ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.


```python
forecast_df = sf.predict(h=horizon) 
forecast_df
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | CrostonClassic |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2023-01-31 20:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 1   | 1         | 2023-01-31 21:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 2   | 1         | 2023-01-31 22:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| ... | ...       | ...                 | ...            |
| 497 | 1         | 2023-02-21 13:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 498 | 1         | 2023-02-21 14:00:00 | 27.418417      |
| 499 | 1         | 2023-02-21 15:00:00 | 27.418417      |

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/main/nbs/imgs/ChainedWindows.gif)

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=)`, forecasting every second hour
`(step_size=50)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents $h$ steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 500 hours ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.


```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=df,
                                         h=horizon,
                                         step_size=50,
                                         n_windows=5)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` series identifier.
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the `n_windows`.
-   `y:` true value
-   `model:` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.


```python
crossvalidation_df
```

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

Now we are going to evaluate our model with the results of the
predictions, we will use different types of metrics MAE, MAPE, MASE,
RMSE, SMAPE to evaluate the accuracy.


```python
from functools import partial

import utilsforecast.losses as ufl
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
evaluate(
    test.merge(Y_hat),
    metrics=[ufl.mae, ufl.mape, partial(ufl.mase, seasonality=season_length), ufl.rmse, ufl.smape],
    train_df=train,
)
```

|     | unique_id | metric | CrostonClassic |
|-----|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 0   | 1         | mae    | 33.704756      |
| 1   | 1         | mape   | 0.632593       |
| 2   | 1         | mase   | 0.804074       |
| 3   | 1         | rmse   | 45.262709      |
| 4   | 1         | smape  | 0.767960       |

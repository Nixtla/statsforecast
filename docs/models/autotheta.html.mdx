## Introduction<a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

The development of accurate, robust and reliable forecasting methods for
univariate time series is very important when large numbers of time
series are involved in the modelling and forecasting process. In
industrial settings, it is very common to work with large lines of
products; thus, efficient sales and operational planning (S&OP) depend
heavily on accurate forecasting methods.

The Theta method [(Assimakopoulos & Nikolopoulos, 2000, hereafter
A&N)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207000000662)
is applied to non-seasonal or deseasonalised time series, where the
deseasonalisation is usually performed via the multiplicative classical
decomposition. The method decomposes the original time series into two
new lines through the so-called theta coefficients, denoted by
${\theta}_1$ and ${\theta}_2$ for
${\theta}_1, {\theta}_2 \in \mathbb{R}$, which are applied to the second
difference of the data. The second differences are reduced when
${\theta}<1$, resulting in a better approximation of the long-term
behaviour of the series (Assimakopoulos, 1995). If ${\theta}$ is equal
to zero, the new line is a straight line. When ${\theta}>1$ the local
curvatures are increased, magnifying the short-term movements of the
time series (A&N). The new lines produced are called theta lines,
denoted here by $\text{Z}(\theta_1)$ and $\text{Z}(\theta_2)$. These
lines have the same mean value and slope as the original data, but the
local curvatures are either filtered out or enhanced, depending on the
value of the $\theta$ coefficient.

In other words, the decomposition process has the advantage of
exploiting information in the data that usually cannot be captured and
modelled completely through the extrapolation of the original time
series. The theta lines can be regarded as new time series and are
extrapolated separately using an appropriate forecasting method. Once
the extrapolation of each theta line has been completed, recomposition
takes place through a combination scheme in order to calculate the point
forecasts of the original time series. Combining has long been
considered as a useful practice in the forecasting literature (for
example, [Clemen, 1989, Makridakis and Winkler, 1983, Petropoulos et
al., 2014]()), and therefore its application to the Theta method is
expected to result in more accurate and robust forecasts.

The Theta method is quite versatile in terms of choosing the number of
theta lines, the theta coefficients and the extrapolation methods, and
combining these to obtain robust forecasts. However, A&N proposed a
simplified version involving the use of only two theta lines with
prefixed $\theta$ coefficients that are extrapolated over time using a
linear regression (LR) model for the theta line with ${\theta}_1 =0$ and
simple exponential smoothing (SES) for the theta line with
${\theta}_2 =2$. The final forecasts are produced by combining the
forecasts of the two theta lines with equal weights.

The performance of the Theta method has also been confirmed by other
empirical studies (for example Nikolopoulos et al., 2012, Petropoulos
and Nikolopoulos, 2013). Moreover, Hyndman and Billah (2003), hereafter
H&B, showed that the simple exponential smoothing with drift model
(SES-d) is a statistical model for the simplified version of the Theta
method. More recently, Thomakos and Nikolopoulos (2014) provided
additional theoretical insights, while Thomakos and Nikolopoulos (2015)
derived new theoretical formulations for the application of the method
to multivariate time series, and investigated the conditions under which
the bivariate Theta method is expected to forecast better than the
univariate one. Despite these advances, we believe that the Theta method
deserves more attention from the forecasting community, given its
simplicity and superior forecasting performance.

One key aspect of the Theta method is that, by definition, it is
dynamic. One can choose different theta lines and combine the produced
forecasts using either equal or unequal weights. However, AN limit this
important property by fixing the theta coefficients to have predefined
values.

The contributions of this work are fourfold. First, we extend the A&N
method by the optimal selection of the theta line that describes the
short-term movements of the series best, maintaining the long-term
component. The forecasts derived from the two theta lines are combined
using appropriate weights, which ensures the recomposition of the
original time series. Second, we provide theoretical and practical links
between the newly proposed model, the original Theta method and the
SES-d model. Third, we also perform a further extension of the model
that allows the regression line (the long term component) to be revised
at every time period.

## Theta method <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

### The original Theta method

Originally, AN proposed the theta line as the solution of the equation

$$

\begin{equation}
    \nabla^2 \text{Z}_t (\theta) =\theta \nabla^2 Y_t, \ \ t=3, \cdots, n \tag 1
\end{equation}

$$

where $Y_1, \cdots Y_n$ is the original time series (non-seasonal or
deseasonalised) and $\nabla$ is the difference operator (i.e.,
$\nabla X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}$). The initial values of $\text{Z}_1$ and
$\text{Z}_2$ are obtained by minimising
$\sum_{t=1}^n [Y_t -\text{Z}_t(\theta)]^2$. However, an analytical
solution to compute the $\text{Z}(\theta)$ was obtained by H&B, which is
given by

$$

\begin{equation}
    \text{Z}_t(\theta)=\theta Y_t +(1-\theta)(A_n +B_n t) \ \ t=1, \cdots n \tag 2
\end{equation}

$$

where $\text{A}_n$ and $\text{B}_n$ are the minimum square coefficients
of a simple linear regression over $Y_1, \cdots Y_n$ against \$1, n \$,
given by

$$

\begin{equation}
    \text{A}_n =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} Y_t -\frac{n+1}{2} \text{B}_n ; \ \ \text{B}_n= \frac{6}{n^2 -1} (\frac{2}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} tY_t -\frac{1+n}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} Y_t ) \tag 3
\end{equation}

$$

From this point of view, the theta lines can be interpreted as functions
of the linear regression model applied to the data directly. However,
note that $\text{A}_n$ and $\text{B}_n$ are only functions of the
original data, not parameters of the Theta method.

Finally, the forecasts produced by the Theta method for $h$ steps ahead
of are an ad-hoc combination (50%-50%) of the extrapolations of
$\text{Z}(0)$ and $\text{Z}(2)$ by the linear regression model and the
simple exponential smoothing model respectively. We will refer to the
above setup as the standard Theta method (STheta).

The steps for building the STheta method of AN are as follows: 1.
Deseasonalisation: The time series is tested for statistically
significant seasonal behaviour. A time series is seasonal if
$$|r_m|>q_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{1+2 \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} r_{i}^2}{n} }$$

where $r_k$ denotes the lag $k$ autocorrelation function, $m$ is the
number of the periods within a seasonal cycle (for example, 12 for
monthly data), $n$ is the sample size, $q$ is the quantile function of
the standard normal distribution, and $(1-\alpha)\%$ is the confidence
level. A&N opted for a 90% confidence level. If the time series is
identified as seasonal, then it is deseasonalised via the classical
decomposition method, assuming the seasonal component to have a
multiplicative relationship.

1.  Decomposition: The seasonally adjusted time series is decomposed
    into two theta lines, the linear regression line $\text{Z}(0)$ and
    the theta line $\text{Z}(2)$.

2.  Extrapolation: $\text{Z}(0)$ is extrapolated as a normal linear
    regression line, while $\text{Z}(2)$ is extrapolated using SES.

3.  Combination: The final forecast is a combination of the forecasts of
    the two theta lines using equal weights.

4.  Reseasonalisation: If the series was identified as seasonal in step
    1, then the final forecasts are multiplied by the respective
    seasonal indices.

### Models for optimising the Theta method

Assume that either the time series $Y_1, \cdots Y_n$ is non-seasonal or
it has been seasonally adjusted using the multiplicative classical
decomposition approach.

Let $X_t$ be the linear combination of two theta lines,

$$

\begin{equation}
    X_t=\omega \text{Z}_t (\theta_1) +(1-\omega) \text{Z}_t (\theta_2) \tag 4
\end{equation}

$$

where $\omega \in [0,1]$ is the weight parameter. Assuming that
$\theta_1 <1$ and $\theta_2 \geq 1$, the weight $\omega$ can be derived
as

$$

\begin{equation}
    \omega:=\omega(\theta_1, \theta_2)=\frac{\theta_2 -1}{\theta_2 -\theta_1} \tag 5
\end{equation}

$$

It is straightforward to see from Eqs. (4), (5) that
$X_t=Y_t, \ t=1, \cdots n$ i.e., the weights are calculated properly in
such a way that Eq. (4) reproduces the original series. In Theorem 1 of
[Appendix
A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207016300243#s000075)
, we prove that the solution is unique and that the error from not
choosing the optimal weights ($\omega$ and $1-\omega$) s proportional to
the error of a linear regression model. As a consequence, the STheta
method is given simply by setting $\theta_1=0$ and $\theta_2=2$ while
from Eq. (5) we get $\omega=0.5$. Thus, Eqs. (4), (5) allow us to
construct a generalisation of the Theta model that maintains the
re-composition propriety of the original time series for any theta lines
$\text{Z}_t (\theta_1)$ and $\text{Z}_t (\theta_2)$.

In order to maintain the modelling of the long-term component and retain
a fair comparison with the STheta method, in this work we fix
$\theta_1=0$ and focus on the optimisation of the short-term component,
$\theta_2=0$ with $\theta \geq 1$. Thus, $\theta$ is the only parameter
that requires estimation so far. The theta decomposition is now given by

$$Y_t=(1-\frac{1}{\theta}) (\text{A}_n+\text{B}_n t)+ \frac{1}{\theta} \text{Z}_t (\theta), \ t=1, \cdots , n$$

The $h$ -step-ahead forecasts calculated at origin are given by

$$

\begin{equation}
    \hat Y_{n+h|n} = (1-\frac{1}{\theta}) [\text{A}_n+\text{B}_n (n+h)]+ \frac{1}{\theta} \tilde {\text{Z}}_{n+h|n} (\theta) \tag 6
\end{equation}

$$

where
$\tilde {\text{Z}}_{n+h|n} (\theta)=\tilde {\text{Z}}_{n+1|n} (\theta)=\alpha \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-\alpha)^i \text{Z}_{n-i}(\theta)+(1-\alpha)^n \ell_{0}^{*}$
is the extrapolation of $\text{Z}_t(\theta)$ by an SES model with
$\ell_{0}^{*} \in \mathbb{R}$ as the initial level parameter and
$\alpha \in (0,1)$ as the smoothing parameter. Note that for $\theta=2$
Eq. (6) corresponds to Step 4 of the STheta algorithm. After some
algebra, we can write

$$

\begin{equation}
    \tilde {\text{Z}}_{n+1|n} (\theta)=\theta \ell{n}+(1-\theta) \{ \text{A}_n [1-(1-\alpha)^n] + \text{B}_n [n+(1-\frac{1}{\alpha}) [1-(1-\alpha)^n] ]  \}   \tag 7
\end{equation}

$$

where $\ell_{t}=\alpha Y_t +(1-\alpha) \ell_{t-1}$ for $t=1, \cdots, n$
and $\ell_{0}=\ell_{0}^{*}/\theta$.

In the light of Eqs. (6), (7), we suggest four stochastic approaches.
These approaches differ due to the parameter $\theta$ which may be
either fixed at two or optimised, and the coefficients $\text{A}_n$ and
$\text{B}_n$, which can be either fixed or dynamic functions. To
formulate the state space models, it is helpful to adopt $\mu_{t}$ as
the one-step-ahead forecast at origin $t-1$ and $\varepsilon_{t}$ as the
respective additive error, i.e., $\varepsilon_{t}=Y_t - \mu_{t}$ if
$\mu_{t}= \hat Y_{t|t-1}$. We assume $\{  \varepsilon_{t} \}$ to be a
Gaussian white noise process with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$.

### Optimised and standard Theta models

Let $\text{A}_n$ and $\text{B}_n$ be fixed coefficients for all
$t=1, \cdots, n$ so that Eqs. (6), (7) configure the state space model
given by

$$

\begin{equation}
    Y_t=\mu_{t}+\varepsilon_{t} \tag 8
\end{equation}

$$

$$

\begin{equation}
    \mu_{t}=\ell_{t-1}+(1-\frac{1}{\theta}) \{(1-\alpha)^{t-1} \text{A}_n +[\frac{1-(1-\alpha)^t}{\alpha} \text{B}_n]  \tag 9 \}
\end{equation}

$$

$$

\begin{equation}
    \ell_{t}=\alpha Y_t +(1-\alpha)\ell_{t-1} \tag{10}
\end{equation}

$$

with parameters $\ell_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$, $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and
$\theta \in [1,\infty)$ . The parameter $\theta$ is to be estimated
along with $\alpha$ and $\ell_{0}$ We call this the optimised Theta
model (OTM).

The $h$-step-ahead forecast at origin $n$ is given by

$$\hat Y_{n+h|n}=E[Y_{n+h}|Y_1,\cdots, Y_n]=\ell_{n}+(1-\frac{1}{\theta}) \{(1-\alpha)^n \text{A}_n +[(h-1) + \frac{1-(1-\alpha)^{n+1}}{\alpha}] \text{B}_n \}$$

which is equivalent to Eq. (6). The conditional variance
$\text{Var}[Y_{n+h}|Y_1, \cdots, Y_n]=[1+(h-1)\alpha^2]\sigma^2$ can be
computed easily from the state space model. Thus, the $(1-\alpha)\%$
prediction interval for $Y_{n+h}$ is given by
$$\hat Y_{n+h|n} \ \pm  \ q_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{[1+(h-1)\alpha^2 ]\sigma^2 }$$

For $\theta=2$ OTM reproduces the forecasts of the STheta method;
hereafter, we will refer to this particular case as the standard Theta
model (STM). In Theorem 2 of [Appendix
A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207016300243#s000075),
we show that OTM is mathematically equivalent to the SES-d model. As a
corollary of Theorem 2, STM is mathematically equivalent to SES-d with
$b=\frac{1}{2} \text{B}_n$. Therefore, for $\theta=2$ the corollary also
re-confirms the H&B result on the relationship between STheta and the
SES-d model.

import scipy.stats as stats
```


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf

plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5

    'savefig.facecolor':'#212946',
    'axes.grid': True,
    'axes.grid.which': 'both',
    'axes.spines.left': False,
    'axes.spines.right': False,
    'axes.spines.top': False,

    'font.size': 12 }
plt.rcParams.update(dark_style)

from pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18,7)
```

### Read Data

```python
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naren8520/Serie-de-tiempo-con-Machine-Learning/main/Data/candy_production.csv")
df.head()
```

|     | observation_date | IPG3113N |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| 0   | 1972-01-01       | 85.6945  |
| 1   | 1972-02-01       | 71.8200  |
| 2   | 1972-03-01       | 66.0229  |
| 3   | 1972-04-01       | 64.5645  |
| 4   | 1972-05-01       | 65.0100  |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds         | y       | unique_id |
|-----|------------|---------|-----------|
| 0   | 1972-01-01 | 85.6945 | 1         |
| 1   | 1972-02-01 | 71.8200 | 1         |
| 2   | 1972-03-01 | 66.0229 | 1         |
| 3   | 1972-04-01 | 64.5645 | 1         |
| 4   | 1972-05-01 | 65.0100 | 1         |

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds            object
y            float64
unique_id     object
dtype: object
```

We can see that our time variable `(ds)` is in an object format, we need
to convert to a date format

```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

## Explore Data with the plot method <a class="anchor" id="plotting"></a>

Plot some series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class.
This method prints aa random series from the dataset and is useful for
basic EDA.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

### Autocorrelation plots

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=60, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=60, ax=axs[1],color="lime")
axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')

plt.show();
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/AutoTheta_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-9-output-1.png)

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets 1. Data to train our
[`AutoTheta`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autotheta)
model 2. Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 12 months to test and evaluate
the performance of our model.

```python
train = df[df.ds<='2016-08-01'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2016-08-01']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((536, 3), (12, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.

```python
sns.lineplot(train,x="ds", y="y", label="Train", linewidth=3, linestyle=":")
sns.lineplot(test, x="ds", y="y", label="Test")
plt.ylabel("Candy Production")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.show()
```

## Implementation of AutoTheta with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

### Load libraries

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import AutoTheta
```

### Instantiate Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful.season_length.

Automatically selects the best Theta (Standard Theta Model `(‘STM’)`,
Optimized Theta Model `(‘OTM’)`, Dynamic Standard Theta Model
`(‘DSTM’)`, Dynamic Optimized Theta Model `(‘DOTM’))` model using mse.

```python
season_length = 12 # Monthly data 
horizon = len(test) # number of predictions

# We call the model that we are going to use
models = [AutoTheta(season_length=season_length,
                     decomposition_type="additive",
                     model="STM")]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [panda’s
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.

```python
sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='MS')
```

### Fit Model

```python
sf.fit(df=train)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[AutoTheta])
```

Let’s see the results of our Theta model. We can observe it with the
following instruction:

```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
result
```

Let us now visualize the residuals of our models.

As we can see, the result obtained above has an output in a dictionary,
to extract each element from the dictionary we are going to use the
`.get()` function to extract the element and then we are going to save
it in a `pd.DataFrame()`.

```python
residual=pd.DataFrame(result.get("residuals"), columns=["residual Model"])
residual
```

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 90% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min. (If you want to speed things up to a couple of seconds,
remove the AutoModels like
[`ARIMA`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#arima)
and
[`Theta`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#theta))

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[95]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 95% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.

```python
sf.predict(h=horizon)
```

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/main/nbs/imgs/ChainedWindows.gif)

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=5)`, forecasting every second months
`(step_size=12)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 12 months ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.

```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=train,
                                         h=horizon,
                                         step_size=12,
                                         n_windows=5)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` series identifier.
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the n_windows.
-   `y:` true value
-   `"model":` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.

```python
crossvalidation_df
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | cutoff     | y        | AutoTheta  |

| 59  | 1         | 2016-08-01 | 2015-08-01 | 104.6977 | 114.248257 |

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

Now we are going to evaluate our model with the results of the
predictions, we will use different types of metrics MAE, MAPE, MASE,
RMSE, SMAPE to evaluate the accuracy.

```python
from functools import partial

import utilsforecast.losses as ufl
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
evaluate(
    test.merge(Y_hat),
    metrics=[ufl.mae, ufl.mape, partial(ufl.mase, seasonality=season_length), ufl.rmse, ufl.smape],
    train_df=train,
)
```

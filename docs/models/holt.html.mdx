## Introduction<a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

The Holts model, also known as the double exponential smoothing method,
is a forecasting technique widely used in time series analysis. It was
developed by Charles Holt in 1957 as an improvement on Brown’s simple
exponential smoothing method.

The Holts model is used to predict future values of a time series that
exhibits a trend. The model uses two smoothing parameters, one for
estimating the trend and the other for estimating the level or base
level of the time series. These parameters are called $\alpha$ and
$\beta$, respectively.

The Holts model is an extension of Brown’s simple exponential smoothing
method, which uses only one smoothing parameter to estimate the trend
and base level of the time series. The Holts model improves the accuracy
of the forecasts by adding a second smoothing parameter for the trend.

One of the main advantages of the Holts model is that it is easy to
implement and does not require a large amount of historical data to
generate accurate predictions. Furthermore, the model is highly
adaptable and can be customized to fit a wide variety of time series.

However, Holts’ model has some limitations. For example, the model
assumes that the time series is stationary and that the trend is linear.
If the time series is not stationary or has a non-linear trend, the
Holts model may not be the most appropriate.

In general, the Holts model is a useful and widely used technique in
time series analysis, especially when the series is expected to exhibit
a linear trend.

## Holt Method <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

`Simple exponential smoothing` does not function well when the data has
trends. In those cases, we can use *double exponential smoothing*. This
is a more reliable method for handling data that consumes trends without
seasonality than compared to other methods. This method adds a time
*trend* equation in the formulation. Two different weights, or smoothing
parameters, are used to update these two components at a time.

Holt’s exponential smoothing is also sometimes called *double
exponential smoothing*. The main idea here is to use SES and advance it
to capture the *trend* component.

Holt (1957) extended simple exponential smoothing to allow the
forecasting of data with a *trend*. This method involves a forecast
equation and two smoothing equations (one for the *level* and one for
the *trend*):

Assume that a series has the following:

-   Level
-   Trend
-   No seasonality
-   Noise

where $\ell_{t}$ denotes an estimate of the level of the series at time
$t, b_t$ denotes an estimate of the trend (slope) of the series at time
$t, \alpha$ is the smoothing parameter for the level, $0\le\alpha\le1$,
and $\beta^{*}$ is the smoothing parameter for the trend,
$0\le\beta^*\le1$.

As with simple exponential smoothing, the level equation here shows that
$\ell_{t}$ is a weighted average of observation $y_{t}$ and the
one-step-ahead training forecast for time $t$, here given by
$\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}$. The trend equation shows that $b_t$ is a
weighted average of the estimated trend at time $t$ based on
$\ell_{t} - \ell_{t-1}$ and $b_{t-1}$, the previous estimate of the
trend.

The forecast function is no longer flat but trending. The $h$-step-ahead
forecast is equal to the last estimated level plus $h$ times the last
estimated trend value. Hence the forecasts are a linear function of $h$.

### Innovations state space models for exponential smoothing

The exponential smoothing methods presented in Table 7.6 are algorithms
which generate point forecasts. The statistical models in this tutorial
generate the same point forecasts, but can also generate prediction (or
forecast) intervals. A statistical model is a stochastic (or random)
data generating process that can produce an entire forecast
distribution.

Each model consists of a measurement equation that describes the
observed data, and some state equations that describe how the unobserved
components or states (level, trend, seasonal) change over time. Hence,
these are referred to as state space models.

For each method there exist two models: one with additive errors and one
with multiplicative errors. The point forecasts produced by the models
are identical if they use the same smoothing parameter values. They
will, however, generate different prediction intervals.

To distinguish between a model with additive errors and one with
multiplicative errors. We label each state space model as ETS( .,.,.)
for (Error, Trend, Seasonal). This label can also be thought of as
ExponenTial Smoothing. Using the same notation as in Table 7.5, the
possibilities for each component are: $Error=\{A,M\}$,
$Trend=\{N,A,A_d\}$ and $Seasonal=\{N,A,M\}$

For our case, the linear Holt model with a trend, we are going to see
two cases, both for the additive and the multiplicative

### ETS(A,A,N): Holt’s linear method with additive errors

For this model, we assume that the one-step-ahead training errors are
given by
$\varepsilon_t=y_t-\ell_{t-1}-b_{t-1} \sim \text{NID}(0,\sigma^2)$.
Substituting this into the error correction equations for Holt’s linear
method we obtain

where, for simplicity, we have set $\beta=\alpha \beta^*$

### ETS(M,A,N): Holt’s linear method with multiplicative errors

Specifying one-step-ahead training errors as relative errors such that

$$\varepsilon_t=\frac{y_t-(\ell_{t-1}+b_{t-1})}{(\ell_{t-1}+b_{t-1})}$$

and following an approach similar to that used above, the innovations
state space model underlying Holt’s linear method with multiplicative
errors is specified as

where again $\beta=\alpha \beta^*$ and
$\varepsilon_t \sim \text{NID}(0,\sigma^2)$.

### A taxonomy of exponential smoothing methods

Building on the idea of time series components, we can move to the ETS
taxonomy. ETS stands for “Error-Trend-Seasonality” and defines how
specifically the components interact with each other. Based on the type
of error, trend and seasonality, Pegels (1969) proposed a taxonomy,
which was then developed further by Hyndman et al. (2002) and refined by
Hyndman et al. (2008). According to this taxonomy, error, trend and
seasonality can be:

1.  Error: “Additive” (A), or “Multiplicative” (M);
2.  Trend: “None” (N), or “Additive” (A), or “Additive damped” (Ad), or
    “Multiplicative” (M), or “Multiplicative damped” (Md);
3.  Seasonality: “None” (N), or “Additive” (A), or “Multiplicative” (M).

The components in the ETS taxonomy have clear interpretations: level
shows average value per time period, trend reflects the change in the
value, while seasonality corresponds to periodic fluctuations
(e.g. increase in sales each January). Based on the the types of the
components above, it is theoretically possible to devise 30 ETS models
with different types of error, trend and seasonality. Figure 1 shows
examples of different time series with deterministic (they do not change
over time) level, trend, seasonality and with the additive error term.

![“Figure 1: Time series corresponding to the additive error ETS
models”](https://openforecast.org/adam/Svetunkov--2022----ADAM_files/figure-html/ETSTaxonomyAdditive-1.png)
*Figure 4.1: Time series corresponding to the additive error ETS models*

Things to note from the plots in Figure.1:

1.  When seasonality is multiplicative, its amplitude increases with the
    increase of the level of the data, while with additive seasonality,
    the amplitude is constant. Compare, for example, ETS(A,A,A) with
    ETS(A,A,M): for the former, the distance between the highest and the
    lowest points in the first year is roughly the same as in the last
    year. In the case of ETS(A,A,M) the distance increases with the
    increase in the level of series;
2.  When the trend is multiplicative, data exhibits exponential
    growth/decay;
3.  The damped trend slows down both additive and multiplicative trends;
4.  It is practically impossible to distinguish additive and
    multiplicative seasonality if the level of series does not change
    because the amplitude of seasonality will be constant in both cases
    (compare ETS(A,N,A) and ETS(A,N,M)).

*Figure 2: Time series corresponding to the multiplicative error ETS
models*

The graphs in Figure 2 show approximately the same idea as the additive
case, the main difference is that the error variance increases with
increasing data level; this becomes clearer in ETS(M,A,N) and ETS(M,M,N)
data. This property is called heteroskedasticity in statistics, and
Hyndman et al. (2008) argue that the main benefit of multiplicative
error models is to capture this characteristic.

### Mathematical models in the ETS taxonomy

I hope that it becomes more apparent to the reader how the ETS framework
is built upon the idea of time series decomposition. By introducing
different components, defining their types, and adding the equations for
their update, we can construct models that would work better in
capturing the key features of the time series. But we should also
consider the potential change in components over time. The “transition”
or “state” equations are supposed to reflect this change: they explain
how the level, trend or seasonal components evolve.

As discussed in Section 2.2, given different types of components and
their interactions, we end up with 30 models in the taxonomy. Tables 1
and 2 summarise mathematically all 30 ETS models shown graphically on
Figures 1 and 2, presenting formulae for measurement and transition
equations.

From a statistical point of view, formulae in Tables 1 and 2 correspond
to the “true models”, they explain the models underlying potential data,
but when it comes to their construction and estimation, the $\epsilon_t$
is substituted by the estimated $e_t$ (which is calculated differently
depending on the error type), and time series components and smoothing
parameters are also replaced by their estimates (e.g. $\hat \alpha$
instead of $\alpha$). However, if the values of these models’ parameters
were known, it would be possible to produce point forecasts and
conditional h steps ahead expectations from these models.

### Properties Holt’s linear trend method

Holt’s linear trend method is a time series forecasting technique that
uses exponential smoothing to estimate the level and trend components of
a time series. The method has several properties, including:

1.  Additive model: Holt’s linear trend method assumes that the time
    series can be decomposed into an additive model, where the observed
    values are the sum of the level, trend, and error components.

2.  Smoothing parameters: The method uses two smoothing parameters, α
    and β, to estimate the level and trend components of the time
    series. These parameters control the amount of smoothing applied to
    the level and trend components, respectively.

3.  Linear trend: Holt’s linear trend method assumes that the trend
    component of the time series follows a straight line. This means
    that the method is suitable for time series data that exhibit a
    constant linear trend over time.

4.  Forecasting: The method uses the estimated level and trend
    components to forecast future values of the time series. The
    forecast for the next period is given by the sum of the level and
    trend components.

5.  Optimization: The smoothing parameters α and β are estimated through
    a process of optimization that minimizes the sum of squared errors
    between the predicted and observed values. This involves iterating
    over different values of the smoothing parameters until the optimal
    values are found.

6.  Seasonality: Holt’s linear trend method can be extended to
    incorporate seasonality components. This involves adding a seasonal
    component to the model, which captures any systematic variations in
    the time series that occur on a regular basis.

Overall, Holt’s linear trend method is a powerful and widely used
forecasting technique that can be used to generate accurate predictions
for time series data with a constant linear trend. The method is easy to
implement and can be extended to handle time series data with seasonal
variations.

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.


```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds                  | y      | unique_id |
|-----|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| 0   | 2017-09-13T00:00:00 | 80115  | 1         |

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds           object
y             int64
unique_id    object

```

We can see that our time variable `(ds)` is in an object format, we need
to convert to a date format


```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

### The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a type of statistical test that
determines whether a unit root is present in time series data. Unit
roots can cause unpredictable results in time series analysis. A null
hypothesis is formed in the unit root test to determine how strongly
time series data is affected by a trend. By accepting the null
hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data is not
stationary. By rejecting the null hypothesis or accepting the
alternative hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data
is generated by a stationary process. This process is also known as
stationary trend. The values of the ADF test statistic are negative.
Lower ADF values indicate a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis.

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test is a common statistical test used to test
whether a given time series is stationary or not. We can achieve this by
defining the null and alternate hypothesis.

-   Null Hypothesis: Time Series is non-stationary. It gives a
    time-dependent trend.

-   Alternate Hypothesis: Time Series is stationary. In another term,
    the series doesn’t depend on time.

-   ADF or t Statistic \< critical values: Reject the null hypothesis,
    time series is stationary.

-   ADF or t Statistic \> critical values: Failed to reject the null
    hypothesis, time series is non-stationary.


```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

def Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_func(series , column_name):
    print (f'Dickey-Fuller test results for columns: {column_name}')
    dftest = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    dfoutput = pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['Test Statistic','p-value','No Lags Used','Number of observations used'])
    for key,value in dftest[4].items():
       dfoutput['Critical Value (%s)'%key] = value
    print (dfoutput)
    if dftest[1] <= 0.05:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("Reject the null hypothesis")
        print("The data is stationary")
    else:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("The null hypothesis cannot be rejected")
        print("The data is not stationary")
```

### Autocorrelation plots

**Autocorrelation Function**

**Definition 1.** Let $\{x_t;1 ≤ t ≤ n\}$ be a time series sample of
size n from $\{X_t\}$. 1. $\bar x = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{x_t}{n}$ is
called the sample mean of $\{X_t\}$. 2.
$c_k =\sum_{t=1}^{n−k} (x_{t+k}- \bar x)(x_t−\bar x)/n$ is known as the
sample autocovariance function of $\{X_t\}$. 3. $r_k = c_k /c_0$ is said
to be the sample autocorrelation function of $\{X_t\}$.

Note the following remarks about this definition:

-   Like most literature, this guide uses ACF to denote the sample
    autocorrelation function as well as the autocorrelation function.
    What is denoted by ACF can easily be identified in context.

-   Clearly c0 is the sample variance of $\{X_t\}$. Besides,
    $r_0 = c_0/c_0 = 1$ and for any integer $k, |r_k| ≤ 1$.

-   When we compute the ACF of any sample series with a fixed length
    $n$, we cannot put too much confidence in the values of $r_k$ for
    large k’s, since fewer pairs of $(x_{t +k }, x_t )$ are available
    for calculating $r_k$ as $k$ is large. One rule of thumb is not to
    estimate $r_k$ for $k > n/3$, and another is $n ≥ 50, k ≤ n/4$. In
    any case, it is always a good idea to be careful.

-   We also compute the ACF of a nonstationary time series sample by
    Definition 1. In this case, however, the ACF or $r_k$ very slowly or
    hardly tapers off as $k$ increases.

-   Plotting the ACF $(r_k)$ against lag $k$ is easy but very helpful in
    analyzing time series sample. Such an ACF plot is known as a
    correlogram.

-   If $\{X_t\}$ is stationary with $E(X_t)=0$ and $\rho_k =0$ for all
    $k \neq 0$,thatis,itisa white noise series, then the sampling
    distribution of $r_k$ is asymptotically normal with the mean 0 and
    the variance of $1/n$. Hence, there is about 95% chance that $r_k$
    falls in the interval $[−1.96/\sqrt{n}, 1.96/\sqrt{n}]$.

Now we can give a summary that (1) if the time series plot of a time
series clearly shows a trend or/and seasonality, it is surely
nonstationary; (2) if the ACF $r_k$ very slowly or hardly tapers off as
lag $k$ increases, the time series should also be nonstationary.

**Partial autocorrelation**

Let $\{X_t\}$ be a stationary time series with $E(X_t) = 0$. Here the
assumption $E(X_t ) = 0$ is for conciseness only. If
$E(X_t) = \mu \neq 0$, it is okay to replace $\{X_t\}$ by
$\{X_t −\mu \}$. Now consider the linear regression (prediction) of
$X_t$ on $\{X_{t−k+1:t−1}\}$ for any integer $k ≥ 2$. We use $\hat X_t$
to denote this regression (prediction):
$$\hat X_t =\alpha_1 X_{t−1}+···+\alpha_{k−1} X_{t−k+1}$$

where $\{\alpha_1, · · · , \alpha_{k−1} \}$ satisfy

$$\{\alpha_1, · · · , \alpha_{k−1} \}=\argmin_{\beta_1,···,\beta{k−1}} E[X_t −(\beta_1 X_{t−1} +···+\beta_{k−1} X_{t−k+1})]^2$$

That is, $\{\alpha_1, · · · , \alpha_{k−1} \}$ are chosen by minimizing
the mean squared error of prediction. Similarly, let $\hat X_{t −k}$
denote the regression (prediction) of $X_{t −k}$ on
$\{X_{t −k+1:t −1}\}$:

$$\hat X_{t−k} =\eta_1 X_{t−1}+···+\eta_{k−1} X_{t−k+1}$$

Note that if $\{X_t\}$ is stationary, then
$\{\alpha_{1:k−1} \} = \{\eta_{1:k−1} \}$. Now let
$\hat Z_{t−k} = X_{t−k} − \hat X_{t−k}$ and $\hat Z_t = X_t − \hat X_t$.
Then $\hat Z_{t−k}$ is the residual of removing the effect of the
intervening variables $\{X_{t−k+1:t−1} \}$ from $X_{t−k}$, and
$\hat Z_t$ is the residual of removing the effect of
$\{X_{t −k+1:t −1} \}$ from $X_t$ .

**Definition 2.** The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) at lag $k$
of a stationary time series $\{X_t \}$ with $E(X_t ) = 0$ is

$$\phi_{11} = Corr(X_{t−1}, X_t ) = \frac{Cov(X_{t−1}, X_t )} {[Var(X_{t−1})Var(X_t)]^{1/2}} = \rho_1$$
and

$$\phi_{kk} = Corr(\hat Z_{t−k},\hat Z_t) = \frac{Cov(\hat Z_{t−k},\hat Z_t)} {[Var(\hat Z_{t −k} )Var(\hat Z_t )]^{1/2}}, \ k ≥ 2$$

On the other hand, the following theorem paves the way to estimate the
PACF of a stationary time series, and its proof can be seen in Fan and
Yao (2003).

**Theorem 1.** Let $\{X_t \}$ be a stationary time series with
$E(X_t ) = 0$, and $\{a_{1k},··· ,a_{kk}\}$ satisfy

$$\{a_{1k},··· ,a_{kk}\}= \argmin_{a_1 ,··· ,a_k}  E(X_t − a_1 X_{t−1}−···−a_k X_{t−k})^2$$

Then $\phi_{kk} =a_{kk}$ for $k≥1$.


```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[1],color="lime")

### Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* Multiplicative

### Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

### Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$

### Additive


```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "additive", period=12)
a.plot();
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/Holt_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-11-output-1.png)

### Multiplicative


```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "Multiplicative", period=12)
a.plot();
```

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets 1. Data to train our `Holt Model`. 2.
Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 30 hours to test and evaluate the
performance of our model.


```python
train = df[df.ds<='2017-09-20 17:00:00'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2017-09-20 17:00:00']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((186, 3), (30, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.


```python
sns.lineplot(train,x="ds", y="y", label="Train", linestyle="--")
sns.lineplot(test, x="ds", y="y", label="Test")
plt.title("Ads watched (hourly data)");
plt.show()
```

## Implementation of Holt Method with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

### Load libraries


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import Holt
```

### Instantiate Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful for `season_length`.


```python
season_length = 24 # Hourly data 
horizon = len(test) # number of predictions

models = [Holt(season_length=season_length, error_type="A", alias="Add"),
          Holt(season_length=season_length, error_type="M", alias="Multi")]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.


```python
sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='h')
```

### Fit the Model


```python
sf.fit(df=train)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[Add,Multi])
```

Let’s see the results of our `Holt Model`. We can observe it with the
following instruction:


```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
print(result.keys())
print(result['fit'])
```

``` text
dict_keys(['loglik', 'aic', 'bic', 'aicc', 'mse', 'amse', 'fit', 'residuals', 'components', 'm', 'nstate', 'fitted', 'states', 'par', 'sigma2', 'n_params', 'method', 'actual_residuals'])
results(x=array([9.99900000e-01, 1.00000000e-04, 7.97982888e+04, 3.33340440e+02]), fn=4456.295090550272, nit=74, simplex=None)
```

Let us now visualize the fitted values of our models.

As we can see, the result obtained above has an output in a dictionary,
to extract each element from the dictionary we are going to use the
`.get()` function to extract the element and then we are going to save
it in a `pd.DataFrame()`.


```python
residual=pd.DataFrame(result.get("residuals"), columns=["residual Model"])
residual
```

|     | residual Model |
|-----|----------------|
| 0   | -16.629196     |

| 184 | -1313.391081   |
| 185 | -1428.364244   |


```python
import scipy.stats as stats

fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2)

residual.plot(ax=axs[0,0])
axs[0,0].set_title("Residuals");

sns.distplot(residual, ax=axs[0,1]);
axs[0,1].set_title("Density plot - Residual");

stats.probplot(residual["residual Model"], dist="norm", plot=axs[1,0])
axs[1,0].set_title('Plot Q-Q')

plot_acf(residual,  lags=35, ax=axs[1,1],color="fuchsia")
axs[1,1].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plt.show();
```

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 90% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min.


```python
Y_hat = sf.forecast(df=train, h=horizon, fitted=True)

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level (list of floats):` this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile)
    of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[95]` means that
    the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 95% of
    the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.


```python
sf.predict(h=horizon)
```

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=)`, forecasting every second months
`(step_size=12)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 30 hours ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.


```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=df,
                                         h=horizon,
                                         step_size=30,
                                         n_windows=3)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` series identifier.
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the `n_windows`.
-   `y:` true value
-   `model:` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.

crossvalidation_df

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

Now we are going to evaluate our model with the results of the
predictions, we will use different types of metrics MAE, MAPE, MASE,
RMSE, SMAPE to evaluate the accuracy.


```python
from functools import partial

import utilsforecast.losses as ufl
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
evaluate(
    test.merge(Y_hat),
    metrics=[ufl.mae, ufl.mape, partial(ufl.mase, seasonality=season_length), ufl.rmse, ufl.smape],
    train_df=train,
)
```

|     | unique_id | metric | Add          | Multi        |
|-----|-----------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| 0   | 1         | mae    | 30905.751042 | 48210.098958 |
| 1   | 1         | mape   | 0.336201     | 0.491980     |

| 3   | 1         | rmse   | 38929.522482 | 54653.132768 |
| 4   | 1         | smape  | 0.129755     | 0.182024     |

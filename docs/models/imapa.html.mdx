## Introduction<a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

IMAPA is an algorithm that uses multiple models to forecast the future
values of an intermittent time series. The algorithm starts by adding
the time series values at regular intervals. It then uses a forecast
model to forecast the added values.

IMAPA is a good choice for intermittent time series because it is robust
to missing values and is computationally efficient. IMAPA is also easy
to implement.

IMAPA has been tested on a variety of intermittent time series and has
been shown to be effective in forecasting future values.

## IMAPA Method <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

The Intermittent Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (IMAPA) model
is a time series model for forecasting future values for time series
that are intermittent. The IMAPA model is based on the idea of
aggregating the time series values at regular intervals and then using a
forecast model to forecast the aggregated values. The aggregated values
can be forecast using any forecast model. It uses the optimized SES to
generate the forecasts at the new levels and then combines them using a
simple average.

The IMAPA model can be defined mathematically as follows:

$$\hat{y}_{t+1} = f(\hat{y}_{t-\tau}, \hat{y}_{t-2\tau}, ..., \hat{ y}_{t-m\tau})$$

where $\hat{y}_{t+1}$ is the forecast time value $t+1$, $f$ is the
forecast model,
$\hat{y}_{t-\tau} , \hat{y}_{t-2\tau}, ..., \hat{y}_{t-m\tau}$ are the
forecasts of the added values at times $t-\tau, t-2 \tau, ..., t-m\tau$,
and $\tau$ is the time interval over which the time series values are
aggregated.

IMAPA is a good choice for intermittent time series because it is robust
to missing values and is computationally efficient. IMAPA is also easy
to implement.

IMAPA has been tested on a variety of intermittent time series and has
been shown to be effective in forecasting future values.

### IMAPA General Properties

-   Multiple Aggregation: IMAPA uses multiple levels of aggregation to
    analyze and predict intermittent time series. This involves
    decomposing the original series into components of different time
    scales.

-   Intermittency: IMAPA focuses on handling intermittent time series,
    which are those that exhibit irregular and non-stationary patterns
    with periods of activity and periods of inactivity.

-   Adaptive Prediction: IMAPA uses an adaptive approach to adjust
    prediction models as new data is collected. This allows the
    algorithm to adapt to changes in the time series behavior over time.

-   Robust to Missing Values: IMAPA can handle missing values in the
    data without sacrificing accuracy. This is important for
    intermittent time series, which often have missing values.

-   Computationally Efficient: IMAPA is computationally efficient,
    meaning it can forecast future values quickly. This is important for
    large time series, which can take a long time to forecast using
    other methods.

-   Decomposition Property: Time series can be decomposed into
    components such as trend, seasonality, and residual components.

Next, we import plotting libraries and configure the plotting style.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
plt.style.use('grayscale') # fivethirtyeight  grayscale  classic
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5
dark_style = {
    'figure.facecolor': '#008080',  # #212946
    'axes.facecolor': '#008080',
    'savefig.facecolor': '#008080',
    'axes.grid': True,
    'axes.grid.which': 'both',
    'axes.spines.left': False,
    'axes.spines.right': False,
    'axes.spines.top': False,
    'axes.spines.bottom': False,
    'grid.color': '#000000',  #2A3459
    'grid.linewidth': '1',
    'text.color': '0.9',
    'axes.labelcolor': '0.9',
    'xtick.color': '0.9',
    'ytick.color': '0.9',
    'font.size': 12 }
plt.rcParams.update(dark_style)


from pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18,7)
```


```python
import pandas as pd

df=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naren8520/Serie-de-tiempo-con-Machine-Learning/main/Data/intermittend_demand2")

df.head()
```

|     | date                | sales |
|-----|---------------------|-------|
| 0   | 2022-01-01 00:00:00 | 0     |
| 1   | 2022-01-01 01:00:00 | 10    |
| 2   | 2022-01-01 02:00:00 | 0     |
| 3   | 2022-01-01 03:00:00 | 0     |
| 4   | 2022-01-01 04:00:00 | 100   |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.


```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds                  | y   | unique_id |
|-----|---------------------|-----|-----------|
| 0   | 2022-01-01 00:00:00 | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 2022-01-01 01:00:00 | 10  | 1         |
| 2   | 2022-01-01 02:00:00 | 0   | 1         |
| 3   | 2022-01-01 03:00:00 | 0   | 1         |
| 4   | 2022-01-01 04:00:00 | 100 | 1         |


```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds           object
y             int64
unique_id    object
dtype: object
```

We can see that our time variable `(ds)` is in an object format, we need
to convert to a date format


```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

## Explore Data with the plot method <a class="anchor" id="plotting"></a>

Plot some series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class.
This method prints a random series from the dataset and is useful for
basic EDA.


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

### Autocorrelation plots

Autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots are
statistical tools used to analyze time series. ACF charts show the
correlation between the values of a time series and their lagged values,
while PACF charts show the correlation between the values of a time
series and their lagged values, after the effect of previous lagged
values has been removed.

ACF and PACF charts can be used to identify the structure of a time
series, which can be helpful in choosing a suitable model for the time
series. For example, if the ACF chart shows a repeating peak and valley
pattern, this indicates that the time series is stationary, meaning that
it has the same statistical properties over time. If the PACF chart
shows a pattern of rapidly decreasing spikes, this indicates that the
time series is invertible, meaning it can be reversed to get a
stationary time series.

The importance of the ACF and PACF charts is that they can help analysts
better understand the structure of a time series. This understanding can
be helpful in choosing a suitable model for the time series, which can
improve the ability to predict future values of the time series.

To analyze ACF and PACF charts:

-   Look for patterns in charts. Common patterns include repeating peaks
    and valleys, sawtooth patterns, and plateau patterns.
-   Compare ACF and PACF charts. The PACF chart generally has fewer
    spikes than the ACF chart.
-   Consider the length of the time series. ACF and PACF charts for
    longer time series will have more spikes.
-   Use a confidence interval. The ACF and PACF plots also show
    confidence intervals for the autocorrelation values. If an
    autocorrelation value is outside the confidence interval, it is
    likely to be significant.


```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

# Grafico
plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[1],color="lime")
axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')

plt.show();
```

### Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* Multiplicative

### Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

### Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$


```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def plotSeasonalDecompose(
    x,
    model='additive',
    filt=None,
    period=None,
    two_sided=True,
    extrapolate_trend=0,
    title="Seasonal Decomposition"):

    result = seasonal_decompose(
            x, model=model, filt=filt, period=period,
            two_sided=two_sided, extrapolate_trend=extrapolate_trend)
    fig = make_subplots(
            rows=4, cols=1,
            subplot_titles=["Observed", "Trend", "Seasonal", "Residuals"])
    for idx, col in enumerate(['observed', 'trend', 'seasonal', 'resid']):
        fig.add_trace(
            go.Scatter(x=result.observed.index, y=getattr(result, col), mode='lines'),
                row=idx+1, col=1,
            )
    return fig
```


```python
plotSeasonalDecompose(
    df["y"],
    model="additive",
    period=24,
    title="Seasonal Decomposition")
```

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets

1.  Data to train our `IMAPA Model`.
2.  Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 500 Hours to test and evaluate
the performance of our model.


```python
train = df[df.ds<='2023-01-31 19:00:00'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2023-01-31 19:00:00']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((9500, 3), (500, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.


```python
sns.lineplot(train,x="ds", y="y", label="Train", linestyle="--",linewidth=2)
sns.lineplot(test, x="ds", y="y", label="Test", linewidth=2, color="yellow")
plt.title("Store visit");
plt.xlabel("Hours")
plt.show()
```

## Implementation of IMAPA Method with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

### Load libraries


```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import IMAPA
```

### Instantiating Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful for `season_length`.


```python
season_length = 24 # Hourly data 
horizon = len(test) # number of predictions

models = [IMAPA()]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.


```python
sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='h')
```

### Fit the Model


```python
sf.fit(df=train)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[IMAPA])
```

Let’s see the results of our `IMAPA Model`. We can observe it with the
following instruction:


```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
result
```

``` text
{'mean': array([28.579695], dtype=float32)}
```

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 500 hours ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min.


```python
Y_hat = sf.forecast(df=train, h=horizon)
Y_hat
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | IMAPA     |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| 0   | 1         | 2023-01-31 20:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 1   | 1         | 2023-01-31 21:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 2   | 1         | 2023-01-31 22:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| ... | ...       | ...                 | ...       |
| 497 | 1         | 2023-02-21 13:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 498 | 1         | 2023-02-21 14:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 499 | 1         | 2023-02-21 15:00:00 | 28.579695 |


```python
sf.plot(train, Y_hat)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/IMAPA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-20-output-1.png)

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 500 hours ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.


```python
forecast_df = sf.predict(h=horizon) 
forecast_df
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | IMAPA     |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| 0   | 1         | 2023-01-31 20:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 1   | 1         | 2023-01-31 21:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 2   | 1         | 2023-01-31 22:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| ... | ...       | ...                 | ...       |
| 497 | 1         | 2023-02-21 13:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 498 | 1         | 2023-02-21 14:00:00 | 28.579695 |
| 499 | 1         | 2023-02-21 15:00:00 | 28.579695 |

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/main/nbs/imgs/ChainedWindows.gif)

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=)`, forecasting every second months
`(step_size=50)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 500 hours ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.


```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=df,
                                         h=horizon,
                                         step_size=50,
                                         n_windows=5)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` index. If you dont like working with index just run
    `crossvalidation_df.resetindex()`.
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the `n_windows`.
-   `y:` true value
-   `model:` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.


```python
crossvalidation_df
```

|      | unique_id | ds                  | cutoff              | y    | IMAPA     |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|------|-----------|
| 0    | 1         | 2023-01-23 12:00:00 | 2023-01-23 11:00:00 | 0.0  | 15.134251 |
| 1    | 1         | 2023-01-23 13:00:00 | 2023-01-23 11:00:00 | 0.0  | 15.134251 |
| 2    | 1         | 2023-01-23 14:00:00 | 2023-01-23 11:00:00 | 0.0  | 15.134251 |
| ...  | ...       | ...                 | ...                 | ...  | ...       |
| 2497 | 1         | 2023-02-21 13:00:00 | 2023-01-31 19:00:00 | 60.0 | 28.579695 |
| 2498 | 1         | 2023-02-21 14:00:00 | 2023-01-31 19:00:00 | 20.0 | 28.579695 |
| 2499 | 1         | 2023-02-21 15:00:00 | 2023-01-31 19:00:00 | 20.0 | 28.579695 |

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

Now we are going to evaluate our model with the results of the
predictions, we will use different types of metrics MAE, MAPE, MASE,
RMSE, SMAPE to evaluate the accuracy.


```python
from functools import partial

import utilsforecast.losses as ufl
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
evaluate(
    test.merge(Y_hat),
    metrics=[ufl.mae, ufl.mape, partial(ufl.mase, seasonality=season_length), ufl.rmse, ufl.smape],
    train_df=train,
)
```

|     | unique_id | metric | IMAPA     |
|-----|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 0   | 1         | mae    | 34.206428 |
| 1   | 1         | mape   | 0.637417  |
| 2   | 1         | mase   | 0.816042  |
| 3   | 1         | rmse   | 45.345223 |
| 4   | 1         | smape  | 0.764973  |

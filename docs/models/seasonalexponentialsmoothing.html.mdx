## Introduction <a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) is a forecasting method that uses a
weighted average of historical values to predict the next value. The
weight is assigned to the most recent values, and the oldest values
receive a lower weight. This is because SES assumes that more recent
values are more relevant to predicting the future than older values.

SES is implemented by a simple formula:

$$\hat{y}_{T+1|T} = \alpha y_T + \alpha(1-\alpha) y_{T-1} + \alpha(1-\alpha)^2 y_{T-2}+ \cdots,$$

The smoothing factor controls the amount of weight that is assigned to
the most recent values. A higher α value means more weight will be
assigned to newer values, while a lower α value means more weight will
be assigned to older values.

Seasonality in time series refers to the regular, repeating pattern of
variation in a time series over a specified period of time.

Seasonality can be a challenge to deal with in time series analysis, as
it can obscure the underlying trend in the data.

Seasonality is an important factor to consider when analyzing time
series data. By understanding the seasonal patterns in the data, it is
possible to make more accurate forecasts and better decisions.

## Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Model <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

The simplest of the exponentially smoothing methods is naturally called
simple exponential smoothing (SES). This method is suitable for
forecasting data with no clear trend or seasonal pattern.

Using the naïve method, all forecasts for the future are equal to the
last observed value of the series, $$\hat{y}_{T+h|T} = y_{T},$$

for $h=1,2,\dots$. Hence, the naïve method assumes that the most recent
observation is the only important one, and all previous observations
provide no information for the future. This can be thought of as a
weighted average where all of the weight is given to the last
observation.

Using the average method, all future forecasts are equal to a simple
average of the observed data,
$$\hat{y}_{T+h|T} = \frac1T \sum_{t=1}^T y_t,$$

for $h=1,2,\dots$ Hence, the average method assumes that all
observations are of equal importance, and gives them equal weights when
generating forecasts.

We often want something between these two extremes. For example, it may
be sensible to attach larger weights to more recent observations than to
observations from the distant past. This is exactly the concept behind
simple exponential smoothing. Forecasts are calculated using weighted
averages, where the weights decrease exponentially as observations come
from further in the past — the smallest weights are associated with the
oldest observations:

where $0 \le \alpha \le 1$ is the smoothing parameter. The
one-step-ahead forecast for time $T+1$ is a weighted average of all of
the observations in the series $y_1,\dots,y_T$. The rate at which the
weights decrease is controlled by the parameter $\alpha$.

For any $\alpha$ between 0 and 1, the weights attached to the
observations decrease exponentially as we go back in time, hence the
name “exponential smoothing”. If $\alpha$ is small (i.e., close to 0),
more weight is given to observations from the more distant past. If
$\alpha$ is large (i.e., close to 1), more weight is given to the more
recent observations. For the extreme case where $\alpha=1$,
$\hat{y}_{T+1|T}=y_T$ and the forecasts are equal to the naïve
forecasts.

### How do you know the value of the seasonal parameters?

To determine the value of the seasonal parameter s in the Seasonally
Adjusted `Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES Seasonally Adjusted) model`,
different methods can be used, depending on the nature of the data and
the objective of the analysis.

Here are some common methods to determine the value of the seasonal
parameter $s$:

1.  **Visual Analysis:** A visual analysis of the time series data can
    be performed to identify any seasonal patterns. If a clear seasonal
    pattern is observed in the data, the length of the seasonal period
    can be used as the value of $s$.

2.  **Statistical methods:** Statistical techniques, such as
    autocorrelation, can be used to identify seasonal patterns in the
    data. The value of $s$ can be the number of periods in which a
    significant peak in the autocorrelation function is observed.

3.  **Frequency Analysis:** A frequency analysis of the data can be
    performed to identify seasonal patterns. The value of $s$ can be the
    number of periods in which a significant peak in the frequency
    spectrum is observed.
    [see](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/)

4.  **Trial and error:** You can try different values of $s$ and select
    the value that results in the best fit of the model to the data.

It is important to note that the choice of the value of $s$ can
significantly affect the `accuracy` of the seasonally adjusted SES model
predictions. Therefore, it is recommended to test different values of
$s$ and evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate
evaluation measures before selecting the final value of $s$.

### How can we validate the simple exponential smoothing model with seasonal adjustment?

To validate the Seasonally Adjusted Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES
Seasonally Adjusted) model, different theorems and evaluation measures
can be used, depending on the objective of the analysis and the nature
of the data.

Here are some common theorems used to validate the seasonally adjusted
SES model:

1.  Gauss-Markov Theorem: This theorem states that, if certain
    conditions are met, the least squares estimator is the best linear
    unbiased estimator. In the case of the seasonally adjusted SES, the
    model parameters are estimated using least squares, so the
    Gauss-Markov theorem can be used to assess the quality of model fit.

2.  Unit Root Theorem: This theorem is used to determine if a time
    series is stationary or not. If a time series is non-stationary, the
    seasonally adjusted SES model is not appropriate, since it assumes
    that the time series is stationary. Therefore, the unit root theorem
    is used to assess the stationarity of the time series and determine
    whether the seasonally adjusted SES model is appropriate.

3.  Ljung-Box Theorem: This theorem is used to assess the goodness of
    fit of the model and to determine if the model residuals are white
    noise. If the residuals are white noise, the model fits the data
    well and the model predictions are accurate. The Ljung-Box theorem
    is used to test whether the model residuals are independent and
    uncorrelated.

In addition to these theorems, various evaluation measures, such as root
mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of
determination (R²), can be used to evaluate the performance of the
seasonally adjusted SES model and compare it with other forecast models.

## Loading libraries and data <a class="anchor" id="loading"></a>

> **Tip**
>
> Statsforecast will be needed. To install, see
> [instructions](../getting-started/installation.html).

Next, we import plotting libraries and configure the plotting style.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
plt.style.use('grayscale') # fivethirtyeight  grayscale  classic
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5
dark_style = {
    'figure.facecolor': '#008080',  # #212946
    'axes.facecolor': '#008080',
    'savefig.facecolor': '#008080',
    'axes.grid': True,
    'axes.grid.which': 'both',
    'axes.spines.left': False,
    'axes.spines.right': False,
    'axes.spines.top': False,
    'axes.spines.bottom': False,
    'grid.color': '#000000',  #2A3459
    'grid.linewidth': '1',
    'text.color': '0.9',
    'axes.labelcolor': '0.9',
    'xtick.color': '0.9',
    'ytick.color': '0.9',
    'font.size': 12 }
plt.rcParams.update(dark_style)


from pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18,7)
```

### Read Data

```python
import pandas as pd

df=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naren8520/Serie-de-tiempo-con-Machine-Learning/main/Data/ads.csv")
df.head()
```

|     | Time                | Ads    |
|-----|---------------------|--------|
| 0   | 2017-09-13T00:00:00 | 80115  |
| 1   | 2017-09-13T01:00:00 | 79885  |
| 2   | 2017-09-13T02:00:00 | 89325  |
| 3   | 2017-09-13T03:00:00 | 101930 |
| 4   | 2017-09-13T04:00:00 | 121630 |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds                  | y      | unique_id |
|-----|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| 0   | 2017-09-13T00:00:00 | 80115  | 1         |
| 1   | 2017-09-13T01:00:00 | 79885  | 1         |
| 2   | 2017-09-13T02:00:00 | 89325  | 1         |
| 3   | 2017-09-13T03:00:00 | 101930 | 1         |
| 4   | 2017-09-13T04:00:00 | 121630 | 1         |

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds           object
y             int64
unique_id    object
dtype: object
```

We can see that our time variable `(ds)` is in an object format, we need
to convert to a date format

```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

## Explore Data with the plot method <a class="anchor" id="plotting"></a>

Plot some series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class.
This method prints a random series from the dataset and is useful for
basic EDA.

### The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a type of statistical test that
determines whether a unit root is present in time series data. Unit
roots can cause unpredictable results in time series analysis. A null
hypothesis is formed in the unit root test to determine how strongly
time series data is affected by a trend. By accepting the null
hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data is not
stationary. By rejecting the null hypothesis or accepting the
alternative hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data
is generated by a stationary process. This process is also known as
stationary trend. The values of the ADF test statistic are negative.
Lower ADF values indicate a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis.

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test is a common statistical test used to test
whether a given time series is stationary or not. We can achieve this by
defining the null and alternate hypothesis.

Null Hypothesis: Time Series is non-stationary. It gives a
time-dependent trend. Alternate Hypothesis: Time Series is stationary.
In another term, the series doesn’t depend on time.

ADF or t Statistic \< critical values: Reject the null hypothesis, time
series is stationary. ADF or t Statistic \> critical values: Failed to
reject the null hypothesis, time series is non-stationary.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

def Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_func(series , column_name):
    print (f'Dickey-Fuller test results for columns: {column_name}')
    dftest = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    dfoutput = pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['Test Statistic','p-value','No Lags Used','Number of observations used'])
    for key,value in dftest[4].items():
       dfoutput['Critical Value (%s)'%key] = value
    print (dfoutput)
    if dftest[1] <= 0.05:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("Reject the null hypothesis")
        print("The data is stationary")
    else:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("The null hypothesis cannot be rejected")
        print("The data is not stationary")
```


```python
Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_func(df["y"],'Ads')
```

### Autocorrelation plots

The important characteristics of Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial
Autocorrelation (PACF) are as follows:

Autocorrelation (ACF): 1. Identify patterns of temporal dependence: The
ACF shows the correlation between an observation and its lagged values
at different time intervals. Helps identify patterns of temporal
dependency in a time series, such as the presence of trends or
seasonality.

1.  Indicates the “memory” of the series: The ACF allows us to determine
    how much past observations influence future ones. If the ACF shows
    significant autocorrelations in several lags, it indicates that the
    series has a long-term memory and that past observations are
    relevant to predict future ones.

2.  Helps identify MA (moving average) models: The shape of the ACF can
    reveal the presence of moving average components in the time series.
    Lags where the ACF shows a significant correlation may indicate the
    order of an MA model.

Partial Autocorrelation (PACF): 1. Identify direct dependence: Unlike
the ACF, the PACF eliminates the indirect effects of intermediate lags
and measures the direct correlation between an observation and its
lagged values. It helps to identify the direct dependence between an
observation and its lag values, without the influence of intermediate
lags.

1.  Helps to identify AR (autoregressive) models: The shape of the PACF
    can reveal the presence of autoregressive components in the time
    series. Lags in which the PACF shows a significant correlation may
    indicate the order of an AR model.

2.  Used in conjunction with the ACF: The PACF is used in conjunction
    with the ACF to determine the order of an AR or MA model. By
    analyzing both the ACF and the PACF, significant lags can be
    identified and a model suitable for time series analysis and
    forecasting can be built.

In summary, the ACF and the PACF are complementary tools in time series
analysis that provide information on time dependence and help identify
the appropriate components to build forecast models.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

plot_pacf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[1],color="lime")
axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')

plt.show();
```

### Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* Multiplicative

### Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

### Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$

### Additive

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "additive", period=12)
a.plot();
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/SeasonalExponentialSmoothing_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-11-output-1.png)

### Multiplicative

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "Multiplicative", period=12)
a.plot();
```

## Split the data into training and testing<a class="anchor" id="splitting"></a>

Let’s divide our data into sets

1.  Data to train our `Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Model`.
2.  Data to test our model

For the test data we will use the last 30 hourly to test and evaluate
the performance of our model.

```python
train = df[df.ds<='2017-09-20 17:00:00'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2017-09-20 17:00:00']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((186, 3), (30, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.

```python
sns.lineplot(train,x="ds", y="y", label="Train", linestyle="--")
sns.lineplot(test, x="ds", y="y", label="Test")
plt.title("Ads watched (hourly data)");
plt.show()
```

## Implementation of SeasonalExponentialSmoothing with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

### Load libraries

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import SeasonalExponentialSmoothing
```

### Instantiating Model

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the argument is sometimes
tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful for `season_length`.

```python
season_length = 24 # Hourly data 
horizon = len(test) # number of predictions

models = [SeasonalExponentialSmoothing(alpha=0.8, season_length=season_length)]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the
following parameters:

models: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and
import them.

-   `freq:` a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs:` n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model:` a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.

```python
sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='h')
```

### Fit the Model

```python
sf.fit(df=train)
```

``` text
StatsForecast(models=[SeasonalES])
```

Let’s see the results of our `Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Model`. We
can observe it with the following instruction:

```python
result=sf.fitted_[0,0].model_
result

Let us now visualize the fitted values of our models.

As we can see, the result obtained above has an output in a dictionary,
to extract each element from the dictionary we are going to use the
`.get()` function to extract the element and then we are going to save
it in a `pd.DataFrame()`.

```python
fitted=pd.DataFrame(result.get("fitted"), columns=["fitted"])
fitted["ds"]=df["ds"]
fitted
```

|     | fitted        | ds                  |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|
| 0   | NaN           | 2017-09-13 00:00:00 |
| 1   | NaN           | 2017-09-13 01:00:00 |
| 2   | NaN           | 2017-09-13 02:00:00 |
| ... | ...           | ...                 |

```python

### Forecast Method

If you want to gain speed in productive settings where you have multiple
series or models we recommend using the
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
method instead of `.fit` and `.predict`.

The main difference is that the `.forecast` doest not store the fitted
values and is highly scalable in distributed environments.

The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon)
and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 30 hours ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min.

```python
Y_hat = sf.forecast(df=train, h=horizon, fitted=True)
Y_hat
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | SeasonalES    |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2017-09-20 18:00:00 | 161567.593750 |
| 1   | 1         | 2017-09-20 19:00:00 | 163186.562500 |
| 2   | 1         | 2017-09-20 20:00:00 | 134410.937500 |
| ... | ...       | ...                 | ...           |
| 27  | 1         | 2017-09-21 21:00:00 | 106145.601562 |
| 28  | 1         | 2017-09-21 22:00:00 | 93383.164062  |
| 29  | 1         | 2017-09-21 23:00:00 | 79489.718750  |

```python
values=sf.forecast_fitted_values()
values.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | y        | SeasonalES |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|----------|------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2017-09-13 00:00:00 | 80115.0  | NaN        |
| 1   | 1         | 2017-09-13 01:00:00 | 79885.0  | NaN        |
| 2   | 1         | 2017-09-13 02:00:00 | 89325.0  | NaN        |
| 3   | 1         | 2017-09-13 03:00:00 | 101930.0 | NaN        |
| 4   | 1         | 2017-09-13 04:00:00 | 121630.0 | NaN        |

```python
sf.plot(train, Y_hat)
```

### Predict method with confidence interval

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

The predict method takes two arguments: forecasts the next `h` (for
horizon) and `level`.

-   `h (int):` represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 30 hourly ahead.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals.

This step should take less than 1 second.

```python
forecast_df = sf.predict(h=horizon) 
forecast_df
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | SeasonalES    |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2017-09-20 18:00:00 | 161567.593750 |
| 1   | 1         | 2017-09-20 19:00:00 | 163186.562500 |
| 2   | 1         | 2017-09-20 20:00:00 | 134410.937500 |
| ... | ...       | ...                 | ...           |
| 27  | 1         | 2017-09-21 21:00:00 | 106145.601562 |
| 28  | 1         | 2017-09-21 22:00:00 | 93383.164062  |
| 29  | 1         | 2017-09-21 23:00:00 | 79489.718750  |

## Cross-validation <a class="anchor" id="cross_validate"></a>

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, Cross Validation is done by defining a sliding
window across the historical data and predicting the period following
it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a better
estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider range of
temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training set
contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

### Perform time series cross-validation

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 5 months `(n_windows=5)`, forecasting every second months
`(step_size=12)`. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1 min.

The cross_validation method from the StatsForecast class takes the
following arguments.

-   `df:` training data frame

-   `h (int):` represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 30 hourly ahead.

-   `step_size (int):` step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows(int):` number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.

```python
crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=df,
                                         h=horizon,
                                         step_size=12,
                                         n_windows=3)
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id:` series identifier.
-   `ds:` datestamp or temporal index
-   `cutoff:` the last datestamp or temporal index for the n_windows.
-   `y:` true value
-   `"model":` columns with the model’s name and fitted value.

```python
crossvalidation_df
```

|     | unique_id | ds                  | cutoff              | y        | SeasonalES    |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| 0   | 1         | 2017-09-19 18:00:00 | 2017-09-19 17:00:00 | 161385.0 | 162297.953125 |

| 88  | 1         | 2017-09-21 22:00:00 | 2017-09-20 17:00:00 | 95155.0  | 93383.164062  |
| 89  | 1         | 2017-09-21 23:00:00 | 2017-09-20 17:00:00 | 80285.0  | 79489.718750  |

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

Now we are going to evaluate our model with the results of the
predictions, we will use different types of metrics MAE, MAPE, MASE,
RMSE, SMAPE to evaluate the accuracy.

```python
from functools import partial

import utilsforecast.losses as ufl
from utilsforecast.evaluation import evaluate
```


```python
evaluate(
    test.merge(Y_hat),
    metrics=[ufl.mae, ufl.mape, partial(ufl.mase, seasonality=season_length), ufl.rmse, ufl.smape],
    train_df=train,
)
```

|     | unique_id | metric | SeasonalES  |
|-----|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 0   | 1         | mae    | 5728.207812 |
| 1   | 1         | mape   | 0.049386    |
| 2   | 1         | mase   | 0.707731    |
| 3   | 1         | rmse   | 7290.840738 |
| 4   | 1         | smape  | 0.024009    |

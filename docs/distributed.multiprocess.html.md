  The computational efficiency of `StatsForecast` can be tracked to its two core
  components:<br/>1. Its `models` written in NumBa that optimizes Python code to
  reach C speeds.<br/>2. Its `core.StatsForecast` class that enables distributed
  computing.<br/>This is a low-level class enabling other distribution
  methods.<br/><br/>

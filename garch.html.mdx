## Generate GARCH data

## Generate GARCH(p,q) model

### `garch_model`

```python
garch_model(x, p, q)
```

### `garch_forecast`

```python
garch_forecast(mod, h)
```

### Comparison with arch library

This section compares the coefficients generated by the previous
functions with the coefficients generated by the [arch
library](https://github.com/bashtage/arch) for $p=q$, $p>q$, $p<q$, and
$q=0$.
